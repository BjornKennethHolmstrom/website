Method: Although the author recommend laying down, sitting, standing or even walking may also works. Relax and breathe deeply but make employing awareness the single objective. In particular awareness of the thought as a sensation on its own is useful.

Stages of perception experienced by the author.

I am existence with an ego that has a particular past

I am existence with a particular ego

I am existence of all possible egos

I am all of existence

After going through the levels above expansion of perceived potential futures was experienced

Beyond that, time and space appear to collapse and interpretations or insights were decided to no longer be of any value to pursue for the sake of this text.

### **Insights from a session** of Contemplation and Meditation

## Part I: Metaphysical

The unreal is what fears. It especially fears change. But fear does not have any ground for action in reality. For fear to have a ground there must be a real reason to fear. But since causality can be observed to not exist in actuality, no cause exist that can be correctly associated with and attributed to fear. Causality hinges on the mind believing it its partitions of experience to be actual, but no particular thing exist in actuality. Only thoughts seem to occur and assume the function of pointing to things, but neither the thoughts themselves nor the things they point to can be traced by awareness to have any beginning, end or other real bound separating it from anything else.

Note how, by taking into account the above, current reality is very arbitrary, and thus how valid other conceivable configurations become. This may assist in accepting Part II as achievable and 'real'.

#### Part II : practical

All life on Earth is at the brink of where it can evolve to no longer need to reproduce and play the survival game. Quite logically, the immense struggle to survive humanity's past mistakes will push and align all efforts in this directions.

Life on Earth can begin to populate other planets along with extraterrestrial life. The time it will take might until it starts to happen may be around 100 years. A few things listed below will be useful:

To end abuse and violence between humans, other mammals and vertebrates. Gradually extended to plants.

To begin the process of overcoming the need to redistribute resources for food and manufacturing. Nature can organize in stable ecosystems providing all necessary resources to its participant elements, where humans are not apart, and neither controlling but just one of the involved elements.

After doing the above all disease will end.

In conjunction with this, it is necessary to end speciesism. This means mammals and vertebrates must be recognized and treated as full individuals the same as humans. To do this humans must also end all its internal fraction into -isms. Another requirement is to stop conceptualizing different futures and more and more only consider the present.

Having achieved the above the first sustainable attempts at colonization outside Earth may begin.

Other useful bits. The end of corporational and institutional specialization of labor. That means all formal education.

The end of speciesism between and towards all animals not yet included.

To extend recognition of plants as individual beings.

End the bookkeeping of possessions. With this follows getting rid of governing institutions, division of cultures and nations and personal or individual histories.

Now other dimensions than linear time and three-dimensional space open up to be collectively traversable

Global enlightenment occurs around here which will be equivalent with universal enlightenment as distances through space are no longer the boundary they appear to be now. Unconditional happiness and love is equivalent with enlightenment.
