Ageism is institutionalized in modern nations as the "age of majority"...

How obvious this is if we just think about it for a moment. Imagine just looking at a person around their passing a certain age. Forget about anything like celebrations etc, just think about a person sitting calmly somewhere. Where is the difference in them between one moment and another? There is in essence no change of course! Everyone can be as responsible or irresponsible at any time, and there is no ultimate arbiter. When you see this, it is blatantly obvious that the need for an "age of majority" come only from fear!

What is does is maintain artificial "celebrations" that are extremely useless and even harmful. For example, getting drunk with alcohol is just as bad for your health before that arbitrary age as before it! Only that after passing it the hypocrisy of harming oneself is culturally justified!

Ageism is another large elephant in the room along with speciesism that humanity will have to face in the coming years. The best way to face it is of course by self-reflection. Can you see how busy we are playing games around who is who?
