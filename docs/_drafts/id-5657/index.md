Observing a discussion about punishment of rapists on Facebook led me to write a list of the dual mind transitioning into non-dual stages:

In the list I use mathematical comparators `>`, = from mathematics to illustrate whether the person or persons to the left side think that one group or person it identifies with are somehow 'greater than' or 'equal to' to the ones to the right  
  
We start at the lowest level in the post, the one which was the average among the comments. Note however that there are even lower and more unconscious stages

- me/us do evil `>` they/he did evil (but yup, there are lower unconscious stages!)
- we/us do good `>` they did evil
- we/us do good `>` they do good or evil
- we either do good or evil = they do good/evil. Here we something like the ideal of democracy. Of course, most democracies still operate 'secretely' in the notion that we do good `>` they do evil whenever there is something that the democracy think it needs to protect, that is usually whenever something really important is going on, which threatens the collective idea of the nation etc.
- 'poor us, we/I lack x,y, z' `<` everything else that has x, y or z is "good and above" . This is a contrast to nations/people feeling superior.
- I'm/we're "independent", intellectual and superior > dumb collective. Examples are international 'knowers', but also something as innocent as a follower of only a certain kind of music genre can end up here.
- Totally neutral, I/we don't care about anything (as long as I/we get to maintain our separateness!)
- All is God = always good! Here are the positive/spiritual people in mega-denial. Having to care or see anything that is perceived as not fitting this world view is extremely uncomfortable and dealt with extremely selfishly.
- Me = you. This is actually slightly enlightened and spiritual, and means that all is God, including evil. Accepts all evil but does not act on any of it.
- God is all, which means we are all equally responsible.

Now we get into non-dual stages

- All is God, and the self is an illusion.

Then there are of course at least 8-9 more but they are states of consciousness like Samadhi beyond cause/effect, thus not thoughts about reality and more fun to experience for oneself by practice
