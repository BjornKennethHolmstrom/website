With the purpose of inspiring some awareness and food for thought for any interested reader we look at some possible answers to the question, 'do you have children?'. At first we might think, this is simple, either they do or they don't. But, if we think a bit more, a person might say yes, no or both, depending on their perceived place in reality / state of mind. To illustrate, here is a list of possible circumstances:

- They might have adopted
- They might have children at the moment
- They might have children, but not be identified with them
- They might have children, but not be personally in charge of them
- They might hold the perspective that all people are equally their children
- They might have had children, but they died
- They might just have their childish self to humor
- They might see that the distinction children/not child is ultimately not true, since reality has no actual bounds or objects

And there could be many more options.

Note that the question we use could be replaced with any question.

We can also make questions about the nature of thoughts and questions.

- Do these statements change the present moment as it is?
- Who makes the questions and answers? Where do they come from?
- Who is it perceiving the thoughts?

To go deeper, we can still ourselves and just observe questions and answers as thoughts arise, come and go within the mind. Is there anything to do here? Would we be alright with not doing anything?
