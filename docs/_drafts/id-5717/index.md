Intellectual activity itself is masturbation of mind/ego, the result of the all-knowing self forgetting what it is, only to have the satisfaction of endlessly rediscovering "knowledge" it already knows. Understanding as an energetic exchange is the pleasure driving the pursuit, it is before actual language and context.  
Divisions of pseudo vs. real intellectual has no importance, those appear in lower states of consciousness lost in games of "good" vs "bad" etc. where things and people erroneously are thought to have fixed identities and states of being, and information on certain topics must be from certain authorities or sources to be "correct".  
  
If we are still interested in intellectual activity and if that involves another party, then we should remember to first connect with the interest of the other.  
There should be at least one part interested in learning. Then there can be understanding.  
Someone teaching, someone else learning  
Someone learning, someone else teaching  
Someone and someone else learning and teaching each other together  
These are cases worth pursuing in my opinion  
When this is not the case, better appreciate silence and sounds for their own sake. Be open, create, explore and be curious instead of thinking in terms of right and wrong.
