**Post 1/3** (copy-paste ready):
```
Hello Bluesky. First post here.

For the last year, my work has focused on bridging heart (consciousness, non-duality, purpose) and mind (systems, governance, logic).

Today, I'm launching my new online hub that brings this all together.

https://bjornkennethholmstrom.org

(⬇️ a thread...)
```

**Post 2/3:**
```
This isn't just a blog. It's an ecosystem of open-source tools and ideas:

🏛️ Global Governance Frameworks
🌀 The Awareness Quartet (Spiralize, Nondualize, etc.)
📚 Complete library of my 12 books & 9 white papers
✍️ Full blog archive (2017 to present)
```

**Post 3/3:**
```
This work is for fellow systems thinkers, consciousness explorers, and those navigating the polycrisis.

If you're exploring solutions to global challenges or the nature of awareness, I'm here to connect.

What part of this ecosystem resonates most with you?

## **Bluesky-Specific Tips:**

- **Use fewer hashtags** - Bluesky doesn't rely on them as heavily
- **Consider pinning** your thread once posted (if Bluesky supports this)
- **Engage with replies** - The community appreciates conversation
- **Cross-reference gently** - You can mention "Also on Twitter as @[yourhandle]" but focus on Bluesky as its own community

## **Timing Strategy:**
I'd recommend launching on Bluesky **either simultaneously with Twitter or within 24 hours**. This creates cohesive momentum across platforms.

The intellectual, systems-thinking crowd on Bluesky will likely be very receptive to your work. It's worth building presence there from day one!

What do you think? Ready to launch on both fronts? 🚀
