After a year of quiet building, I'm excited to share something that feels deeply meaningful: my new personal hub, [bjornkennethholmstrom.org](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.org).

You might rightly ask: "Didn't your old WordPress site work just fine?"

It did, as a blog. But my work has evolved. It's no longer just a linear series of posts; it's now a constellation of interconnected projects and ideas. The old site couldn't show as well how Spiralize connects to Nondualize, or how my writing on governance feeds into the vision for Communize.

This new hub is that map. It's the central lobby for an entire ecosystem dedicated to conscious, systemic development. And it's built with some important principles:

• No tracking, no ads - Your privacy is respected
• RSS feed available - Get updates on your own terms
• Fast, static site - Loads instantly, works everywhere
• Completely open-source - Transparency in everything

For those who've followed my journey, this is the next logical step. It's all here, integrated:

• My complete library (12 books & 9 white papers)
• The "Awareness Quartet" tools
• Global governance frameworks
• My full writing archive

If any of this resonates, I'd be honoured to have you explore: [bjornkennethholmstrom.org](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.org)

Fun fact: Building this hub only took a few days thanks to AI assistants, but the content represents a year of work.
