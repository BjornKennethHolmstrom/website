**Subject:** From Scattered Projects to an Integrated Ecosystem: Launching My New Digital Hub

For the past years, my work has evolved across multiple domains: from the inner landscapes of consciousness to the outer architectures of society.

A personal blog was no longer sufficient to hold these interconnected threads.

Today, I'm launching my new digital hub: https://bjornkennethholmstrom.org

This isn't a redesign; it's a re-architecture. It transforms the blog into a central "lobby" that visually maps and connects an entire ecosystem of open-source tools and ideas, including:

• Global Governance Frameworks: Exploratory models for planetary-scale coordination and meta-governance.
• The Awareness Quartet: A suite of sister sites (Spiralize, Nondualize, Communize, Universalize) exploring the spectrum of human development.
• A Complete Knowledge Library: 12 books and 9 whitepapers on systems thinking, consciousness, and societal renewal.

This static, no-tracking site embodies the principles it discusses: clarity, efficiency, and user sovereignty. It serves as an entry point for collaborators, thinkers, and organizations interested in conscious and systemic development.

I believe the most impactful work happens at the intersections; where inner transformation meets outer systems change.

I'm curious to hear from this network: How do you manage the integration of complex, multi-domain work? What strategies have you found for making your own "ecosystem" of projects accessible to others?
