🐻 About Me 🦋

[to Read in Swedish - click here]

Hi there, welcome to this corner of the Internet. Allow me to introduce myself; I’m Björn a.k.a. Pwnytale — a curious thinker, passionate creator, and dedicated sometimes optimist, sometimes pessimist, sometimes neither, working to bridge the gap between ideas and action. With a background in engineering physics and mathematical optimization, I thrive on exploring uncharted territory and helping others see the connections between seemingly disparate fields. My journey has taken me from software development to Viking crafts, from Sweden to the Basque Country and Japan, gaining invaluable perspectives that continue to shape my approach to life and creation.

My connection with nature and animals runs deep—I learned to read at age three and soon started to love reading books about animals. At a much later age I got involved with animal rights movements like Anonymous for the Voiceless. I envision a world where all living beings can coexist in a harmony that transcends our current understanding of survival and competition.

I also love music, and I have played both piano, drums, bass guitar and acoustic guitar. I played in the band Raskolnikov in my late teens, Devil Killers around age 18 and in Fistful of Heart during the 2000's. I recorded a little solo album in the mid 2010's, check it out under [Creations/Music]

Nicknames

Pwnytale

On platforms like Steam and Twitch, I’m known as Pwnytale. This nickname reflects my love for playing with language. I have played a lot of GeoGuessr via the extension chatguessr as well as various community games such as Whatsamusic and Codenames.

Avión Photon

I'm currently not actively using it, but Avión Photon represents my artistic, experimental and spiritual side past. I’ve explored art, music, poetry and mysticism while living in Amorebieta-Etxano (Zornotza), in the Basque Country, northern Spain. Even though this part of my journey is paused, it remains a foundational influence on my life.
You can find my creations in these areas under the menu [Creations], and some writings related to this period under [Creations->Enlightenment]

What I Do NOW

Currently, I’m partly immersed in projects that range from developing software and games to designing systems for systemic change. My work centers on fostering collaboration and re-imagining what’s possible for individuals, communities, and the planet. A recent related creation of mine is Spiralize.org, a resource for people to learn about Spiral Dynamics, a powerful model of our individual and collective evolution. I feel that what the world needs now is a shift up to stage yellow in the political and societal landscapes.

For over five years, I’ve faced the challenges of long-term depression, a journey that has deeply shaped my outlook on life and creativity.
Some examples of my current activities:

Through projects such as SharedSpheres and CommuniTree, I'm developing platforms for meaningful human connection.

My background in physics and software development (including 14 years at TOMLAB Optimization) informs my approach to systems thinking and technological solutions and has inspired me to the projects MOWED and COSMOS.

I'm have started building a political movement focused on holistic, systemic societal transformation through Fjärilspartiet.

Note: You can explore many of the software projects under the [Code/App] section. Each project reflects my commitment to creating technology that serves human flourishing while respecting ethical principles.

My Role in GlobalGovernanceFramework.org

One of my most ambitious contributions to date is initiating globalgovernanceframework.org, a collaborative platform designed to rethink and reorganize how we steward our planet across domains, nations, and generations. What started as a conceptual exploration—part systems thinking, part ethical dreaming—has grown into a detailed framework for coordinated global action. My role has been to seed its core ideas, organize its structure, and work closely with others (including AIs like ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek and Claude) to develop its vision and practical implementation.

The project reflects my deep belief in humanity’s potential to transcend fragmentation and act in unity without uniformity—to govern not from control, but from care, clarity, and conscious design. It’s a labor of hope, complexity, and love for the Earth and everyone on it.

Why I Do It

I started having mystical experiences after doing a lot of yoga and meditation/awareness work in Sweden sometime before 2014. The experiences increased with time. While living in the Basque Country, my questioning of reality led to me almost leaving normal society completely. I lived with basically no money for almost two years. Eventually my life situation spiraled somewhat out of control, I lost access to the apartment I lived in and moved to an abandoned house where I lived for a month. But in the end I came back to "ordinary" life, with one idea: the intention of creating the best computer game the world has yet seen. This game is HeaRTS.
With the help of my parents and ex-girlfriend and her mother, I moved back to Sweden and started searching for employment for a year, before I went into depression and in-organic psychosis.

The game I envisioned is my current long-term goal, and while it has some core mechanics figured out, still has a lot of its design to figure out.
But while aiming for this I discovered there were so many other things to do, and I am mainly interested in helping the world at the best of my abilities.
I believe that small, intentional actions can ripple outward to create profound change—a "butterfly effect" that touches all levels of existence. A driving question is: How can we improve ourselves and the planet, while avoiding repeating mistakes of the past and keeping true to our essence? These kind of inquiries informs what I do, from my creative endeavors to my contributions toward a fairer, more resilient world.

My Inspirations

Though I draw inspiration from basically anything, here are some examples:

The beauty of interconnected systems in nature, society and reality as a whole.

The potential for technology to empower and uplift humanity.

The pursuit of philosophy, art, science and spirituality as some of the most meaningful activities.

The endless expressions of life and consciousness in nature

The possibility of harmony between all living beings
