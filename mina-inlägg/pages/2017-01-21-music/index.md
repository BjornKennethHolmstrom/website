## Playing music

If you don't count hammering on my mothers piano I have played music since the age of nine/ten (I don't remember the exact age when I started piano classes). I took classes until I was around twenty. During that period I also started playing bass guitar and drums together with one of my brothers as well as a few friends. I later began playing acoustic guitar, mostly video game music, but a few simpler classical pieces as well.

I played in three bands:

Raskolnikov - with one of my brothers and a friend.

Devilkillers - I got recruited to this band while playing drums in a drumming course.

[A Fistful of Heart](https://www.youtube.com/@FistfulofHeart) - with the same brother as in Raskolnikov as well as one of my sisters and two friends.

### AVION PHOTON - VOICELESS FOR THE VOICELESS

I recorded this instrumental album while living in the Basque Country, under my "artist/mystic"-name Avión Photon.  
You can find it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdO6bglTepQ&list=PLMJw6TtOLiQXjCIQqXr06kOtAQ2Orc4Ex), as well as on [Bandcamp](https://avionphoton.bandcamp.com/album/voiceless-for-the-voiceless).
