Goal: Auto-generate a webpage with links from [browser bookmarks](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en)\-files using [Python](https://github.com/BjornKennethHolmstrom/chrome-bookmarks-to-wordpress)

Acronym (because I love them): Python ORacle To ALl (the good stuff)

The first test page should feature a collection of online resources which I have enjoyed and used during my last years.

The generated page should

- **be a model of** how to organize bookmarks
- **provide an goldmine** of links to extremely useful stuff.
- **show excellent organisation** _no matter how many links are added!_
