**Lyrics**

I am a gym nut Got a strong butt Director's cut Make a proud strut

I am a yogi Breathe in breathe out Train calyogy To be out and about

_Fly through life_ _Without any strife_ _Take things as they come_ _Love life in the now_

_The march of the many mees_ _I am you, you are me, we are free_

Make a song in an hour Like this little march Take back your power Sing with the larch

Don't be frightened Of the police nor the thugs Explore strange drugs And you will be enlightened

_Fly through life_ _Without any strife_ _Take things as they come_ _Love life in the now_

_It is the march of the many mees_ _I am you, you are me, we are free_

I am a generous dude A photographer of food A philosopher of sorts All these words support

the truth
