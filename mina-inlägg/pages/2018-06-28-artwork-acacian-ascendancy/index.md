[Back to Art](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/art/)

This artwork is part of a mixed media creation I have undertaken; writing a novel and creating art along with the continued expansion of [game world b³O](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/b%c2%b3o/).

The novel is a story of personal growth where people from a desert village in a disastrous state join inhabitants of a more well functioning community nearby to create a new home in a savanna, occasionally assisted by a mysterious stranger.

As a first sketch of how the new home could look like, the area is a rough approximation of a place in the 3D-game Minecraft, and the result will probably differ a lot.

I used lead pencils for the initial layout, then ink pens to fill in contours and dark areas and finally colored pencils to give it more life.
