I started with lead pencils for the composition and first outlines on standard college block paper. I set the general tones with layers of colored pencil and then accentuated contours and put in depth, contrasts and dark shadows with ink pens; especially for the inside of the sand worm's mouth. I used a white highlighter for the scales, the hair of Alia and whirls of the sand. I highlighted the teeth with blue brush pens and made the sand more lively with a golden ink brush pen. I blended the pencil colors with a water brush pen.
