**Background and preparation**

The idea for Moon Wish came in a dream. The dream was a brief visual flash and lasted less than a second, but I knew what it was immediately; It was the moon with life similar to the Earth! I felt the dream was a wish from the moon as it is now to be depicted with life.

The next days I researched the moon's geology by reading and making sketches. I wanted to get a grasp on the placement and shapes of the largest seas and craters.

I knew the current scientific theory of how moon was formed from a collision with Earth by a Mars-sized body. Would it have evolved life too, were it not for the collision? Could the moon host life in the future?

I thought about the climate. Would the seas dry out each lunar cycle? Would the clouds move differently from how they move on earth? Would there be polar ice?

**Drawing and materials**

Not completely certain I still began the drawing on paper.

First I put down the shapes of the craters, seas and mountains using pencils.

Then I created different zones with colored pencils.

To stay true to the dream, I let the ecology balance to something stabler, but the desert area on the eastern side is a residue from considering this question. I kept the idea that rain clouds travel towards the unlit side due to day on the moon lasting half a month on Earth. I did not any divisions of concentric climate zones along the rotational axis, even if it might be more realistic.

Then I rested one night before blending the coloring with water, adding more geographical details with ink pens, colored brush ink pens and another round of colored pencils. I filled the dark space behind and made the outer atmosphere more vibrant with a black ink marker and smaller clouds and stars using white highlighter.
