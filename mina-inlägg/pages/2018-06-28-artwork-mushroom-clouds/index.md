**Background and idea**

I have a thing for re-purposing overgrown structures. There is an abandoned nuclear power plant not very far from where I live which inspired this creation. While that one is empty of residents as far as I know, this chimney hosts someone who thought building a rickety structure on top of it would be worth the effort. Could it have been the great view over the forest that brought it forth? Or the extra sunlight, enough to grow grapes and other crops?

**Materials**

I used pencils to create an initial sketch, then ink pens for contours and darkness, and then colored pencils for the surfaces. I blended the colors with a water brush pen. Since the paper is very thin, it unfortunately created undulations, especially around the sky.
