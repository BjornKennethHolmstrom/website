This artwork is part of a mixed media creation I have undertaken; writing a novel and creating art along with the continued expansion of [game world b³O](http://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/b%c2%b3o/). The novel is a story of personal growth where people from a desert village in a disastrous state join inhabitants of a more well functioning community nearby to create a new home in a savanna, occasionally assisted by a mysterious stranger.

The drawing shows the meeting between a gigantic owl and the stranger.

I used lead pencils for the general composition and rough sketch, then colored pencils for shades and textures and finally ink pens to fill in contours and create more contrast, giving the result a cartoony feel.
