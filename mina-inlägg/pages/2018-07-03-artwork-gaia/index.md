[Back to Art](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/art/)

I drew Gaia just after getting this advice from a friend and artist: "'You can study Michelangelo as much as you want, but when it comes to art, just forget everything"

I set out to draw a male character, but it ended up female. I also had the intention to make it happy, but it turned out crying, and I cried myself why drawing it.  
I felt this was a sorrow inside me connected to seeing the environment not being cared for and feeling inadequate to act and realize all the changes I know is possible.  
So, Gaia as you might know is our planet personified. The light bulb represents enlightenment, and my wish for more people to become more aware.

I used lead pencils for the contours and composition, then filled them in with ink pens. finally I colored with pencils and used a water brush pen to blend them. I also added some shades with lead pencil.
