[Back to Art](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/art/)

I drew this meditatively, similar to how I drew [Landscape](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/artwork-landscape/), after listening to a guided meditation where I was asked to imagine myself walking on a road and eventually enter a building. What I sensed in my imagination was very unclear, but I think the drawing has some resemblances, such as the colored windows and the oak door.

I drew with black ink pen to start with and later filled in with colored pencils
