This is a summary of some unique and rare experience. They might seem 'unusual' but I believe they are possible to experience for anyone due to the infinite nature of reality and consciousness.

To have them, a completely open mind is necessary, questioning deeply the nature of all thoughts and beliefs contradicting the possibility of these occurring.

If that is very hard, implementing a regular mindfulness and meditation practice can help. This is highly individual. Note that achieving such a goal is nothing better or 'higher' than say, eating your favorite food. What I just wrote in the previous sentence is very important.

The list:

- Completely letting go as a way of receiving any requested information instantly and directly into the brain about anything

- Knowing each new manifestation of appearances as self-generated (and knowing its trail back in time)

- Knowing and recognizing the mutual generation of own life and the history of the "outside" world/universe as one and the same. No events more/less significant, total butterfly effect.

- Knowing all experience as mystical; unconsciousness within familiarity and repetition dulls the perception and interpretation to make it seem otherwise, that is the nature of all habitual/addiction-based action with lack of mindfulness. The depths of what is habit and addiction goes much deeper than what is commonly referred to as such. This includes any unconscious act, such as not being aware of how one ties a shoelace, or answering a phone call because of the ringtone. In full consciousness, you are completely aware of the call and the caller being created in the very moment, by yourself.

- Knowing truth and truthfulness as the only real and lasting; all presumed lies or secrets are only temporarily created by an illusory self, which forgets its totality of being and thus acting as if there were various sides to reality.

- Complete dissolution of attachment to body and sensory perception, knowing total bliss and the needlessness of continuing life.

- Knowing any imaginable experience to be possible to be experienced as real. Thus knowing boundlessness in creation and freedom to direct life (as in the infinite experience) to any goal or point within the infinitely infinite field of possibilities.

- Knowing that creating past and future attachments (for example scheduling appointments) are one of the illusory self's (the mind's) way of escaping self-realization, or true being within reality, by clinging to old information and identity.

- Knowing the possibility of 're-enactment' of any past experience, all the way to infancy, in new appearances. Related to this state, personalities are also completely arbitrarily projected on perceived selves and others.

- Knowing the danger of creating new falsehood or untruth in reality when describing what is happening, either in thought or action. Talking or even thinking about something one is going to do, or thinking that one knows something, unless 100% certain of it in that moment, takes one off the path of relative truth and re-establishes illusion.

- Knowing that truth in words are actually not the words themselves, but more fundamental energies of alignment within reality in the present moment. Thus truth is not about examining a statement of the past with some present circumstances, it is about the current state of being of oneself together with ones circumstances.
    

Also, note that knowing in all these statements refers to actually directly experiencing, not to being able to state the experience in a sentence. As some sayings go: "The finger points to the moon, don't confuse the finger with the moon" or "Don't confuse the map with the territory".
