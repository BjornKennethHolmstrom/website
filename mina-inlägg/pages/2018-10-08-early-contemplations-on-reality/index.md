_Notes from 2013 and beyond_

During a trip through Europe to Barcelona in 2013, I had experiences that challenged my then-firmly materialistic worldview and opened up questions I'm still exploring today.

Two observations particularly stand out in my memory:

The first involved a peculiar awareness of connections between events occurring in very short time intervals. At the time, I tried to explain this through purely mechanical means, noting in my travel journal: "delayed conscious experience of exterior event => sense of predetermined future." I even made a small diagram to help me remember the experience. As someone trained in physics, I found these correlations puzzling - they seemed to defy my understanding of causality, yet I couldn't deny what I was experiencing.

What I wrote was "delayed conscious experience of exterior event => sense of predetermined future".

Then I made an illustration I made looked something like this:

I was aware of a strange connection between events within very short time intervals, perhaps even less than seconds. I thought they should be completely uncorrelated, but I could not deny what I felt and observed. The related events could be both thoughts in my head and things people said or did.

The second observation came while walking along a street in Barcelona. I noticed that when I entered a certain state of relaxation, my movement through crowds felt different - almost as if space itself was more fluid than solid. It challenged my assumptions about the nature of physical reality in ways I couldn't easily dismiss.

Looking back at my notes from this period, I see someone grappling with fundamental questions about existence, jotting down pairs of concepts and their relationships:

- Time/Future/Past

- Nothing/Something

- Appear/Disappear/Change

- Light/dark

- Stop/Start, Increase/Decrease

- State: Infinite/Empty

- Desire/Attract/Repel

- Sense-Hear-See-Smell-Taste-Touch-Move

- Operation/operator/operand, function/subject/object

- Point/space

These experiences marked the beginning of a deeper inquiry into the nature of reality - one that continues to evolve. While I don't claim to have definitive answers, these early encounters opened up questions that have profoundly influenced my approach to both philosophical exploration and practical creation, and opened me up to explore new perspectives, including religions and [non-duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism).

I'm curious about others' experiences with moments that challenged their understanding of reality. Have you had experiences that made you question your fundamental assumptions about how the world works? I'd love to hear your thoughts and perspectives.
