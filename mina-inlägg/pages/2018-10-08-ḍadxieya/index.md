### **Story**

As you enter **Ḍādxièya** (ꕩ䪥ﺿ) you find yourself next to what resembles a small square park.  
Next to it is a high stone wall with a map.

The place you appeared in seems to be in the middle of it.  
In chests and on the wall are notes and instructions left by Avión Photon.  
Looking around, you realize that what is you thought was a park is ALSO a large map.

As you look closer you discover signs of different places...  
"Amusement park"  
"Garden monastery"  
"Sanctuary lake"

...

Next to each sign are pressure plates. What will happen if you step on one?  
You choose to step on one of the pressure plates.

\*CLICK\*

you have been teleported away!

The new place is great fun to explore and you feel like visiting the other places too!  
But how will you get back?  
You could walk… but ...  in which direction? How far?  
What if there is a way to get teleported back again instead?

You start wondering about the mysterious writings you saw on the signs when you explored this new place..  
They seem to hint towards something...

### **FAQ**

**_Can anyone solve the puzzles?_**

They might be very hard to solve if you are inexperienced with Minecraft, or even if you are a Minecraft Master. Even the creator of the map gets lost sometimes.

**_I_ _can't solve a puzzle, can you help me?_**

In case you feel very frustrated or just curious, I compiled a PDF with the solutions. Both to remember them myself, and to help anyone struggling with them. It has nice pictures of the builds. I recommend it if you are just curious, hesitant or don't have the game available!! **[Click here to download it.](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/puzzle-solutions.pdf)**

**_Which puzzles are the easiest and which are the hardest? I want to visit them in a certain order!_**

**[Click here to see the build list](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/puzzle-world-build-list)** It has difficulty ratings for the puzzles

**_I don't have Minecraft but would like to see the builds!_**

**[Click here to go to the build list](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/puzzle-world-build-list)** It has links to build journal entries on the Minecraft forums showing each build, and even how they were built. The forums are also a great place to find out more about Minecraft and ask questions about the game.

**_What are the coordinates to spawn and the teleportation map?_**

##### _Where did you get the ideas for the map?_

**Ḍādxièya** was originally just my main personal creative world, a place to build whatever I felt inspired to build. But as I built a few things I eventually I yearned for a way to travel more quickly between locations.  
Although I could use the /tp command, I wanted to try out [command blocks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_Block).  
I also wanted a nice overview of where I had built things. Thus I created the teleportation map. I didn't want to disturb the builds, so I hid the command blocks, integrating their method of activation into the environment.

##### _Where did you get the ideas for the builds?_

Most of the builds are built purely from imagination, but some have external sources:

- The Buddhist temple is inspired by the Tiger's Nest or Paro Taktsang monastery in Tibet \[[wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paro_Taktsang)\]

- Ideas for the Japanese village and house came partly from a book from 1889 by Edward S. Morse. It is 418 pages of detailed descriptions along with beautiful illustrations. It doesn't show up if you just google 'Japanese architecture', so it is a bit of a hidden gem. HTML, Kindle, EPUB, pdf and text of the book are available at [Project Gutenberg,](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52868) but when I built the houses I used [this page](http://www.kellscraft.com/JapaneseHomes/JapaneseHomesContentPage.html) which I find more easy to browse and read than for example the pdf.

- Quotes and poems on signs come from a variety of sources, and are hopefully all correctly attributed in-game. Text authored by myself is usually unsigned.

_**What does the name mean?**_

**Ḍādxièya** is how the characters ꕩ䪥ﺿ are pronounced. Read from the right to the left, the name consists of one [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet), one [Chinese character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters) and one [Vai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vai_syllabary) glyph. I'd like to think of it as a symbol for a dream of a united world without borders, where cultural and national identities no longer play any significant roles. It can also be seen as a prototype idea for how a our different languages might soon be morphed into a common language read and spoken by everyone on Earth. It would of course be more blended, with the different scripts no longer as readily distinguishable, but still. It was created by taking the world seed as decimals, converting it into binary and then into unicode.
