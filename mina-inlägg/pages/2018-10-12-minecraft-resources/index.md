### Resource packs

I have sometimes thought of creating a custom resource pack for Minecraft, including custom music and sounds, but currently I don't think I have the time or will to do it.

Until [Minecraft 1.13](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.13) I used the resource pack made by BDouble0. It is a beautifully modified version of the vanilla textures which aligns very nicely with my play-style.  
**[This link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM7DvbGr-WU)** takes you to BDouble0100's video on YouTube describing all the details of the texture pack, for Minecraft 1.12

### Enhancing graphics

[SEUS](http://www.sonicether.com/seus/#Downloads) - shaders pack. I have mostly used version 10.1. I have used shaders mostly when taking screenshots, but it can enhance the experience when playing as well.
