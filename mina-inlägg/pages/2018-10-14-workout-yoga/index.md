I have practiced [yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali#Eight_limbs) postures or [asanas](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwixkuKRz4XeAhWF2SwKHUrrBGkQFjABegQICBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAsana&usg=AOvVaw3Iw5CTc73pNNoTyiHanh20) since my late teens. I would say hardly anything else has improved the quality of my life as much as yoga. It gives numerous health benefits, is very beginner friendly and anyone can do it!  
The ideal is to exercise the same time each day. As one gradually improves, both the length and difficulty of the exercises can be increased.

#### Equipment

A floor or flat space on the ground with at least 2 square meters of free space. Additionally, a yoga mat can help to keep reference points and soften hard surfaces.

##### My current setup

Here is where I currently exercise. To make the practice hygienic I have covered a rubber yoga mat with a cotton bed sheet. The rubber yoga mats can get smelly over time, but in this way I only need to wash the sheet. It is certainly possible to find an even more natural and Eco-friendly mat.

### My current program

#### Notes

- For each breath I count 4 seconds breathing in and 4 seconds breathing out.
- I have provided links to corresponding Wikipedia articles on as many of the exercises as I can find (click on the name, it should be bold or underlined). The articles have pictures and more information which may be of help.
- [💀](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%F0%9F%92%80 "💀") indicates [corpse pose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavasana). It is very important and is done after several exercises for six breaths, Even if I lay in [💀](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%F0%9F%92%80 "💀") on the back as default, I also do it on the stomach if the exercise before was on the stomach. On the stomach I like to let the head be looking left for three breaths, and then smoothly turn and look right for the remaining three breaths. If the exercise was standing, I usually lay in [💀](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%F0%9F%92%80 "💀") on the back. [💀](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%F0%9F%92%80 "💀") is also the final exercise done for a longer period (read about it in more detail there).
