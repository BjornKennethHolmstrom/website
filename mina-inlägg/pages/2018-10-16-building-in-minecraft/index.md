Get excellent results with Minecraft builds by following the following four steps

## 1\. Find the idea

Brainstorm ideas. If you need help, you can [download this compilation of over 40 pages](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/build-ideas-by-avic3b3n-photon1.pdf "Build Ideas by Avión Photon") — it includes basic builds, survival efficiency builds, complex projects and much more

## **2\. Get a vivid vision**

Answering some questions will get you into the right mindset.

Color palette: _Dark or light? One color, two colors or many?_ Details: _Clean and neat or messy?_ Location:  _Above ground, in a cave, in a certain biome? At some specific coordinates at a location you love?_ Materials: _How many? What specific ones? (Clay, dirt, gravel, sand, sandstone, wood etc)_ Purpose: _Decorative, functional or both? For certain activities? With a storage or even a red-stone contraption?_ Setting, atmosphere and style: _Artificial, detailed, clean or organic? Modern or ancient? Fantasy or realistic? Historical, contemporary or mixed_

## 3\. Make a layout

It is good to prepare properly. Decide the size of the build. For complex builds, use colored blocks to mark different parts.
