**Lyrics - Happy Being**

N/A : The lyrics for this latst version is saved on my laptop in Spain! I hope I'll get it back one day so I can record them.

In the meanwhile at least we have the instrumental which is pretty nice plus the original lyrics with a recording uploaded to SoundCloud (scroll to the bottom to play it).

**Lyrics - The Happy Train Wreck**

_Glistening, shining, rolling on countless wheels_

_Endless evolutions in the industrial revolution_

_From here to there all around the sphere_

_Continent crossed in a mechanized motion_

_Bridging the gap between the east and the west_

_Enticing engineers to do their ultimate best_

_Competing in jest and collaborating with zest_

_Taking their turns to tow trains out to test_

The technological train of havoc to wreck

raises its bar in its reach for stars

Shines out its light from all over this speck

of a blue pale dot between Venus and Mars

_Reaching the pacific but not so pacific_

_Covering lands in sprawling steel strands_

_Technology fueling itself so prolific_

_An extensive effort to deliver due demands_

_Get on the track with nothing to fear_

_Get over the bridge, pass through the junction_

_Pull on the Jackson, shift into gear_

_Gawk at the gadgets in synchronous function_

_Whistling warnings in vapor and smoke_

_Channeling power from a boiling blaze_

_Wagons of wares brought forth by coke_

_Awe-inspiring affairs alarm and amaze_

The technological train of havoc to wreck

raises its bar in its reach for stars

Shines out a light from all over this speck

of a blue pale dot between Venus and Mars
