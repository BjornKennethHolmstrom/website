**Lyrics**

Receive light, take flight Through clouds, insight Rain down, wash clear Dissolve, right here

Take us into Knowing not knowing Dissolving time Synchronous living

Flow and be Let go, to sea Illusion is ground Bound is unbound

Behind the thoughts Another mind Shining through Wise and kind Intelligence vast A spell is cast

Take us into Knowing not knowing Dissolving time Synchronous living
