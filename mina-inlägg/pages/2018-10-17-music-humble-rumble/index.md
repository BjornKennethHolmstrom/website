**Lyrics**

Just a bass master Playing it faster Skipping the cables Flipping the tables

Home from the gym Thinking I'm '[grym](https://www.thelocal.se/20181015/swedish-word-of-the-day-grym)' Clicking with flair Playing it fair

_With all the money_ _We furnished the room_ _We got it running_ _The funk and the shroom_

I'm a bass master Playing it vaster Skipping the cables Flipping the tables

Oh what a sight Smelling the flowers Channeling might Magnificent powers

_Gotta let go_ _To get in the flow_ _Gotta let go_ _To stir up the show_
