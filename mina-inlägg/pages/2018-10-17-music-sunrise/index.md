**Lyrics**

In this time In this universe Someone So much in love

_The sun reflecting in your hair_ _My heart reflecting in your smile_ _Infinite love in a singular moment_ _We are everything and nothing yet_

We can move Mountains Just know The universe is made for us

_The sun reflecting in your hair_ _My heart reflecting in your smile_ _Infinite love in a singular moment_ _We are everything and nothing yet_

Being and nonbeing Coming and going Mutually arising That is our doing
