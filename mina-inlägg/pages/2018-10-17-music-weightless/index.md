**Lyrics**

Somehow we went out of phase I dreamed of flying through space In you it left not a trace I found out how to engage

I picked up and carried my pace You asked me had I packed my case

I was already lost to the chase Of true happiness, behind the haze Mindless veils of humanity's race To a goal which is never in place

All is self, a self without base See it and just be amazed Give up struggles you don't need to face Then time has come for the days

I picked up and carried my pace You asked me had I packed my case

All is self, a self without base Can you see it and just be amazed Give up struggles you don't need to face Then time has come for the days

I picked up and carried my pace You asked me had I packed my case

_The days of_ _Unconditional love to by fully embraced_ _Unconditional love to by fully embraced_ _Unconditional love to by fully embraced_ _Unconditional love to by fully embraced_
