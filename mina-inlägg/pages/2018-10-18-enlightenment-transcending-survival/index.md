title: "Transcending Survival: A Journey Beyond the Need for Sustenance"

Early 2016 I let go of almost all past relationships and belongings and during that process I intuited that the need consume material to survive might be a limiting belief.

While staying attached to food, i did the following

- Ate green leafy vegetables, algae, nuts, seeds, legumes and low-sugar fruits high in vitamins (such as avocado).
- Chewed properly and ate mindfully, planned portions.
- Followed a regular varied workout, a balance between strength, cardio, agility and flexibility, through yoga, calisthenics and gym+gymnastics & parkour.
- Did a meditation at the same time and place for at least 20 minutes daily.

I followed this strictly and in a few years time felt slightly superhuman. By gradually decreasing the amount of food I ate I eventually sensed that eating might not be necessary. Eating appeared to decrease awareness. Even water seemed superfluous.

That said, take care of your physical needs!
