This could be made as a cool matrix of emojis, showing the most typical activity of people in the 24 time zones: Breakfast, Work, Lunch, Work, Dinner, Socializing, Sleeping. It could use flags to show the countries of the time zones.

If we want to post a poem to be read in Japan in the morning at 7 in Kyoto, it should be shown in the evening at 11.

If the local time in Sweden is Saturday 1 P.M. it could show a lunchbox, and since it would be 7 A.M. EST in U.S it could show a green tea or breakfast bowl. It could also show a link symbol in that time zone to show that this is a good time to post to get links.

On Mondays to Thursdays, it could show a 'share' icon.

On Mondays at the time zone which is currently in 11 it could show a traffic light with green to indicate that it is a good time to get traffic from that zone.
