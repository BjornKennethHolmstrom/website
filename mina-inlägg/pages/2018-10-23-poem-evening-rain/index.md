```
Evening rain
in Northern Spain
A soul in pain
with nothing to gain

flaming golden hair
beard like furious fire
bejeweled blue eyes
passionate desire

snivelling snot
sprouting tears
throat in a knot
What does it wear?

A beige shirt
bodhisattva branded
checkered blue underpants
sometimes a skirt
```
