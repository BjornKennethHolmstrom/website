```
Like magnets, we attract
The closer we get, the stronger the bond
We burn away limitations
We soar with new creations
We light up the worlds

We use words but are beyond them
Similar, but not same
Infinite depths within us
Mysterious miracles reflected

Nothing nobody expected
Thus life is perfected
```
