```
The less I know myself
the more I love myself
Those who say 'know thyself'
really mean the opposite

Walk the path which is not marked
it is infinitely broad
Be the place which is nowhere
and you are everywhere at once

Control a single thing to the utmost degree
divide the moment infinitesimally
By inverting reality 
you set yourself free
```
