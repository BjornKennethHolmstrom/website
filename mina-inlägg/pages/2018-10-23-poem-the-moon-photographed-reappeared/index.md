```
The moon photographed reappeared
as a frightful vision in a novel 
Then it exploded in the future 
of a song from years ago

Wading out in cold water

A large lake

Dark green leaves and hanging trees
reflected in the water, four moons. 
In this dream, trying to take flight, 
I fail and fall back down again
```
