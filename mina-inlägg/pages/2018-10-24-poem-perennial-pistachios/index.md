```
Perennial pistachios
A growling gazpacho
She was called Itxaso
I was never a macho

Taking a turn
Leaving the spurn
Is my name really Björn?
There's much more to learn...

Cometh the morning
Avoiding the scorning
Framing the mind
with a flowering grind

Tremble in terror
at every error
Or release into peace
A frivolous frieze

```
