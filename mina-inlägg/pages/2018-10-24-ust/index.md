## Project Overview

The UST (**U**niversal **S**earch **T**ree) project implements a flexible and powerful search tree structure for large-scale data organization and retrieval. It is a versatile tool that can represent and navigate complex hierarchical relationships across various domains, from scientific evolution to linguistic development. The project now includes advanced implementations that combine UST with neural networks, pushing the boundaries of adaptive and hierarchical search structures.

## Key Features

🌳 Dynamic modification of leaves and nodes

✂️ Cut and merge tree operations

🛣️ Shortest path algorithms between leaves

🔗 Unlimited connectivity between leaves and nodes

🧠 Neural network-guided adaptive structures

🔍 Multi-UST enhanced neural networks

📊 Visualization capabilities for all models

🏗️ Hierarchical Neural-UST model for complex data relationships

## Models

1. **Basic UST**: The foundation of the project, offering flexible tree structures with dynamic modifications.

3. **Neural Network-Guided AdaptiveMultiUST**: Combines UST with neural networks for adaptive restructuring.

5. **MultiUST-Enhanced Neural Network**: Integrates UST as a preprocessing layer in neural networks.

7. **Hierarchical Neural-UST Model**: A sophisticated model combining multiple neural networks with UST for handling complex, hierarchical data.
