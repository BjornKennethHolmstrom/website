Maybe I started this project just because I wanted to use the infinity symbol... Or because I love round things. Z∞ is a Zoomable Circular Calendar. It displays a calendar for the year as a circle. Then if you click a month, the month segment also becomes a circle.. and so on, until you can see an hour.

## Key Features

🔄 Circular calendar visualization

🔍 Zoomable interface from year to hour view

🎞️ Smooth animations between zoom levels

⌨️ Keyboard and mouse controls for navigation

## Current Status

🟢 Initial implementation complete

🟢 Basic zooming functionality implemented

🟢 SVG-based rendering

[🟡](https://emojipedia.org/large-yellow-circle) Event handling in day view

🔴 Event handling in all views

🔴 Advanced features (planned)

## Tech Stack

- Current: JavaScript, SVG

## Recent Progress

- Implemented circular calendar visualization

- Developed zooming functionality from year to hour view

- Created smooth transitions between zoom levels

- Implemented keyboard and mouse controls

- Implemented even handling in day view

## Known Issues

- The calendar is tiny and not centered on mobile phones

## Future Directions

1. Event Integration
    - Develop functionality to populate the calendar with events from other projects (TiTo, EPiC, DaMP)
    
    - Create a unified event management system across projects

3. Linkable Schedule Events
    - Implement a system for linking related events
    
    - Enable flexible rescheduling of linked events, similar to layer manipulation in image editing software

5. Enhanced Interaction
    - Improve touch controls for mobile devices
    
    - Develop more intuitive navigation methods

7. Customization Options
    - Allow users to customize colors, themes, and display preferences
    
    - Implement different visualization modes (e.g., spiral view, 3D view)

9. Data Export/Import
    - Create functionality to export calendar data
    
    - Implement import capabilities for standard calendar formats

Some potential challenges and opportunities for the project:

1. Performance optimization, especially when dealing with large numbers of events or rapid zooming.

3. Ensuring accessibility for users with visual impairments or those who rely on screen readers.

5. Balancing the visually appealing circular design with practical usability for day-to-day planning.

7. Exploring how this visualization could provide unique insights into time management and scheduling patterns.
