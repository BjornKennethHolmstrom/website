**Improving communication skills:**

Think about what you are like? What do you have in common?

**6 pillars**

- Assertiveness
- Empathy
- Clarity
- Open-mindedness
- Listening/presence
- Authenticity

**10 ways**

Pay attention!

- Don't multitask
- Don't pundit (push an idea over people)
- Open-ended questions
- Go with the flow
- Say "I don't know" when you don't
- Experience 1 ≠ Experience 2
- Don't regret
- Don't give too much detail (love what you say more than who you talk to)
- Be brief
- Listen
