Local cuisine in the Basque province Bizkaia in the bay of Biscay. I love this dish! Each ingredient's flavor can be distinguished and appreciated on its own. Eat mindfully to help with digestion.

Harvest the beans when the pods are still soft. Then trim the pointy tips with a knife and any strip away fibers too strong to chew.
