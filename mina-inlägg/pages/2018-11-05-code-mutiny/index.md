An artful rebellious expression lost in time

Mutiny was an overlay on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) I wrote in [AutoHotKey](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwji4oON7oneAhUMKywKHfiGB44QFjAAegQIBBAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fautohotkey.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw0-8_UTOqM9ThLTEcsHOvTQ) during my University studies in the early 00's. Apart from the dazzling user interface its fearless features included

- Auto-mute of Spotify's commercials!
- Automatic download and display of song lyrics based on the artist and title of the currently played
- Automatic download and display of bass or guitar tabulature based on the artist and title of the song currently played
- Buttons to pause and continue playing the current song
- Buttons to skip to the next or revert to the previous song
- Other features I have yet to remember!
