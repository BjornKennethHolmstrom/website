## — a mod that makes  Minecraft non-violent

Something of a pitch:

_Do you wish you didn't have to kill mobs to get their drops?_  
_Do you like dyeing blocks and writing books, but not killing octopuses?_  
_Do you like crafting and enchanting books, but not killing cows, horses or rabbits for leather?  
__Do you like hugs?_

Then this mod is for you

Some ideas for features in the first version

- Charcoal can be used as black dye instead of ink sacs

- Books can be crafted without leather, using jungle leaves

- Leather armor can be made with jungle leaves

- Mobs are not hostile and you can get their drops (once only) by right-clicking (hugging) them

- Ocelots do not attack chicken

- Wolves do not attack sheep

- Guardians do not attack octopuses

_Status_: I started working on the mod, but ran into issues immediately. I cannot get even a simple crafting recipe to be modified. I am using [Fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for creating the mod.
