The seed for [bkh.me](http://bkh.me) was planted in my head many years ago when one of my brothers told me he would be very interested to read my thoughts in the form of a blog or a book. Before that moment, I had only a vague feeling that anyone would be interested, and almost no clue that I would be capable of achieving such a feat. It grew on me however that it must be possible to combine all creative outlets I love into one single thing.

And so, as I reached my mid 30's in 2015-2016, I registered a domain on WordPress and wrote my [very first blog post.](https://wp.me/p8jNO4-4) (the date on the post has unfortunately changed!)

Since then, bkh.me has been continuously updated as I learn new things and rediscover old ones.

If you have any questions, I will be happy to respond!
