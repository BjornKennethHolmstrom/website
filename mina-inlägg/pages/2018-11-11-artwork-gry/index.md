Gry was painted during a few weeks in September 2018, when I came back to Sweden after three years abroad.

It depicts symbols for the awakening of consciousness. The crystals of primordial order. The Buddha, true knowledge embodied. Psychedelic mushrooms, hints to a mind outside the limited self. The cave itself is also symbolic: The cave of Plato which most people do not dare exit. The cave to which the hermit or spiritual seeker retreats to, until Truth is revealed.
