Confident, the flyer gazed across the landscape, perched as it was on the biggest branch of Flower Valley's Life Tree, next to the deep light blue crystal sonorizing any access of the oaken chest. The chest stored diamonds accumulated by Esh, the legendary miner and gem cutter, who every day expanded and extended excavations mostly around the caverns and tunnels nesting further down than even the towering tree's roots.

Across the horizon from the northwest, a sudden blinking light appeared: a disc smooth as molten metal running across the sky, suddenly stopping at the savanna heights.

With eyes as wide as the round doors of the underground dwelling of Azu, Vin, Kin, and Kam, the giant grey leaned forth without astonishment or awe but with awakened curiosity. It extended its wings with a drawn-out wooosh, brushing and fanning them hundredfold aside to swoop up and away. Ascending almost vertically at first and then embracing the warm incoming air, it glided, casting a shadow covering the narrow pass from the barren granite cliff to the sheep-grazed, oaky cone-shaped hill marking the natural border between the inhabited valley and beyond.

Increasing speed, the usually nocturnal feathered fellow flew forward, focused on the flickering ahead. Closing in, it saw a funny figure climbing the rocks, planting foreign fruits. Compelled to land, they met, one seven times as tall as the other.

The stranger sang, no words but the meaning was of pure joy, yet so profound it seemed to make the fruits grow, and grow they did; in seconds only, stalks swirled soaring, stretching sinewy strands, exploding in further fruit.

With orange hair, a green cape, shirt, and trousers, blue eyes, and a silver necklace with a jade heart, the anonymous one spoke: "Fruits. Forget to remember." It took a bit of purple-white pulp in its mouth and was gone.

Qal blinked, relaxed his shoulders. Images, yet blurry in his mind, appeared of seven persons. Certainty was of their need — as he flew back to Flower Valley, it was time to assist the newcomers.
