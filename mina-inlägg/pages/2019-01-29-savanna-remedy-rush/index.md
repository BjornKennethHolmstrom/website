In the trickle of dew accumulating along the vines stood the solemn figure, tall, mesmerized by light playing among the leaves of the branches high under a sky stricken pink and orange, with streams of gray-white clouds rolling and unfolding. For a moment, all was still, and then a sudden splash, a crack of a branch, and the figure had leapt into the stream snaking its way across the dense jungle, occasionally widening to the size of a smaller lake. A fast swimmer, this figure with thick long dark brown hair and a blue-green cloth wrapped around her torso quickly approached the border of the jungle opening up to a grassy plain strewn with daffodils, peonies, and poppies. Carrying a bag of some sort, this tall woman with strong legs now sprinted over the hills, scattering wild horses and sheep as she passed them by, securely tracing a path only visible in her mind.

In the horizon, behind four flowery hills rose an enormous tree, oak-like in shape but with gleaming colorful crystals among its branches. Below the hills lay a lake system with lily ponds and leaping fish.

The woman also leapt, across a narrowing at least seven meters across, quickly continued up the slopes, and into a crevasse of a cave. Not a natural one, or at least only partly so, this cave reeked of old ruin blended with something recent and fresh, as if renovated.

Meeting a man in a hood, she exchanged a fleeting moment of words and the container changed hands. Wasting no time, the bare-footed woman tripped up a spiral staircase into a large long hall with face-like illuminated formations for openings on each end and frescoes of landscapes in contrasting direct and reflected light respectively on opposite walls.

Out of the hall, a balcony revealed the majestic tree in full, at least a hundred meters both tall and wide. Taking no heed of the scene, Azu outlined an overview of the day's explored areas onto a map on the wall with colored charcoal.
