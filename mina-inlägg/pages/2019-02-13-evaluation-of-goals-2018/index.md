**Unexpected**

- Moving back to Sweden
- Reconnecting with family

**Reached**

- Apply for three jobs per months
- Post one Minecraft Survival video per week

**Failed**

- Check and clean up email once per day
- Get financed by any opportunity that arrives
- Post one blog post per day. Result: 20/30 in November, 14/31 December
- Post one Minecraft Creative video per week. None after the Halloween themed Pumpkin competition
- Publish one article on Academia per month
- Enter a competition once per month. None in December
- Enter an exposition once per month. None in December
- Finish an art commission. Still not done

**Ambiguous**

- Learn JavaScript (passed 2 recruiting tests, in progress)
- Gradually streamline my social media presence. Slacking on separate promotion and scheduling of activities, especially art, gaming and music.
- Make an economy plan with a secure cash flow to steadily save money. Saving by investments in infrastructure.
- Stream improvised music. Done once on Instagram, but not on separate account promoting album and musicianship.

- Moving back to Sweden
- Reconnecting with family
