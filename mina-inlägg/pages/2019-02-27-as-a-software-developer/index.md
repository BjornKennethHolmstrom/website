Björn K. Holmström has over ten years of experience as a software developer after studying engineering physics with courses mainly in signal processing and system control theory, others being computing, modelling, optimization and pattern recognition.

He started his professional career writing APIs between an integrated optimization environment and libraries of state-of-the-art mathematical optimization solvers. Later in his career he implemented solvers into code directly from research papers. He also wrote an object-oriented software for running test sets over any selection of available optimization solver.
