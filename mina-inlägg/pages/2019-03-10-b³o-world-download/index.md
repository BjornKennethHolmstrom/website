### **Support the future of** b³O**!**

To help make future updates and maintain the world download and this website I gracefully ask you to consider a donation. The amount to donate is up to you but any amount is welcome.

Details for how to donate are available under ‘[Support](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/support/)’ in the menu of this website. The easiest way is to open the support page as a new tab in your browser and follow the instructions while keeping this page open.

You will first be asked to make a transfer, and then to fill in a form. Write ‘minecraft survival' or 'b3O' in both the message field of the form and the transfer so I know what the donation is for.
