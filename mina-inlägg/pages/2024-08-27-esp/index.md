Project Overview

ESP's aim is to create an advanced, extensive simulation of global economics in order to address critical issues such as Universal Basic Income (UBI), global inequality, climate change economics, digital economy and AI impacts, financial stability, and economic development through comprehensive modeling and analysis.

## Key Features

📊 Advanced economic models (national and individual)

💰 UBI simulation capabilities

⏱️ Flexible time granularity (yearly, monthly, daily)

🌐 Interactive web interface

📈 Data visualization with Chart.js

🏦 Integration with World Bank API

## Current Status

🟢 Initial implementation complete

🟢 Basic simulation capabilities

🟢 UBI module implemented

🟢 Web interface developed

🟡 Data visualization (basic implementation)

🟡 C++ optimizations (planned)

🔴 Advanced economic models (in development)

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python (SQLAlchemy, Flask)

- Database: PostgreSQL

- Frontend: Chart.js for visualization

- Future Optimizations: C++

- AI Assistance: Claude and ChatGPT for development and analysis

## Recent Progress

- Implemented SQLAlchemy for database operations

- Developed data fetcher for World Bank API

- Created NationalEconomyModel and IndividualEconomyModel

- Implemented UBIModule for simulating Universal Basic Income scenarios

- Developed Flask-based web interface with simulation controls

## Next Steps

1. Implement C++ optimizations for performance-critical sections

3. Expand test coverage for models and simulation engine

5. Enhance data visualization with more charts and interactivity

7. Develop more sophisticated economic models

9. Conduct extensive simulations on UBI and other economic policies

11. Analyze impacts of digital economy and AI on global economics

13. Model climate change economics and its global effects

## Project Goals

- Provide comprehensive simulations of global economic systems

- Offer insights into the effects of UBI and other economic policies

- Model the interplay between climate change and economic development

- Analyze the impacts of AI and digital technologies on the global economy

- Contribute to the understanding and potential solutions for global inequality

- Create a tool for policymakers and researchers to test economic theories and policies

By leveraging advanced simulations and AI assistance, ESP aims to contribute significantly to our understanding of complex economic issues and help shape effective policies for a more equitable and sustainable global economy.
