**Qu**antum-**In**spired **C**ognitive **A**rchitecture

## Project Overview

QuInCA implements a quantum-inspired cognitive architecture using Python. It models cognitive processes using quantum-inspired algorithms, investigating the emergence of consciousness or intelligence as a complex system phenomenon.  
It will eventually be merged with [BeSAI](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/besai/).

## Key Features

🧠 Quantum-inspired neural networks

🔄 Modular cognitive architecture

⏱️ Real-time processing framework

🎛️ Multi-modal input system

📊 Extensive logging and visualization

## current issues

We are having troubles matching the number of nodes when propagating the network
