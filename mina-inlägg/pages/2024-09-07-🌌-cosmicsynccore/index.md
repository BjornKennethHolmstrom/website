_Advanced P2P Synchronization Technology_

## Project Overview

CosmicSyncCore is the foundational technology, originally aimed at powering the SharedSpheres collaboration platform but later with the extended purpose to support any application. It's designed to provide robust, scalable, and efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) data synchronization across vast distances - even cosmic ones! The vision is to support a non-profit, global platform for apps with close to no server costs, immensely reducing the environmental footprint of digital technology as well as providing a completely secure way for users to protect their personal data and information.

## Key Features

🔗 Advanced P2P networking for minimized server costs

🔄 Real-time data synchronization

🧠 Machine learning-powered intelligent profile matching

🔐 Secure and scalable user profile management

🌐 API for seamless integration with front-end applications

🤝 Ethical collaboration framework

## Tech Stack

Node.js, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy with SQLite (scalable for efficient profile storage), libp2p, Helia, zlib.

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (planned)

## Ethical Principles

- Non-profit structure

- Commitment to diversity and inclusion

- Transparency in operations and algorithms

- User data protection and control

- Privacy-focused design

## Open for Collaboration

Collaborate to help take CosmicSyncCore to the next level! If you're passionate about P2P technologies, distributed systems, or machine learning, come on board!

### Areas for Collaboration:

1. **P2P Optimization**: Fine-tune our P2P protocols for maximum efficiency.
