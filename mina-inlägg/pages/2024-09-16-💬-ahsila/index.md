I thought it would be fun to create a human language from scratch using [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](http://claude.ai). Ahsila is the result.  
You can find the latest version of the Ahsila project, including the lexicon here: [https://github.com/BjornKennethHolmstrom/Ahsila.git](https://github.com/BjornKennethHolmstrom/Ahsila.git)
