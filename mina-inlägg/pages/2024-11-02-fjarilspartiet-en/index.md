### Our Vision

Just as a butterfly undergoes a fascinating transformation from egg to adult, we work toward thorough and well-planned social change. In the egg stage, we are carefully developing our frameworks and structures. We understand that small, well-planned changes can create extensive positive effects throughout society – the so-called butterfly effect.
