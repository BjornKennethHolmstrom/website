## Freedom & Unity Network Through Independent Meaningful Effort

### Vision

FUN(TIME) is a global network connecting people and organizations working towards solving major global and local challenges. We foster unity while preserving individual freedom, creating pathways for meaningful social transformation through collaborative action.

### Core Purpose

Our network aims to address:

- 🌍 Environmental challenges and climate change

- ⚖️ Social inequality and access to resources

- 🤝 Peace and conflict resolution

- 🏥 Global health and wellbeing

- 🎓 Education and knowledge sharing

- 🌱 Sustainable development

### How FUN(TIME) Works

#### Natural Growth Stages

Like Fjärilspartiet, we embrace natural growth and transformation:

- **Egg Stage**: Initial connection and learning

- Accessible from any device

- Works online and offline
