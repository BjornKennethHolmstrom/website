For decades, societies have measured progress primarily through economic metrics like GDP, prioritizing material growth over human flourishing. Yet despite unprecedented prosperity, rates of loneliness, meaninglessness, and disconnection continue to rise. Something crucial is missing from how we define and measure success.

In this groundbreaking book, Björn Kenneth Holmström introduces the Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)—a revolutionary framework for measuring what truly matters in human experience. Drawing on research from psychology, neuroscience, and social science, Holmström first establishes three core dimensions of well-being—love, meaning, and connection—and then expands the model to include three emergent qualities—playfulness, freedom, and resilience—creating a comprehensive six-dimensional framework for understanding human flourishing.

The LMCI offers:

- A holistic approach to measuring well-being that balances stability with adaptability

- Practical assessment tools for individuals, communities, workplaces, and policymakers

- Evidence-based strategies for enhancing all six dimensions of flourishing

- Methods for integrating qualitative and quantitative data into meaningful insights

- A vision for progress that honors cultural diversity while recognizing universal human needs

By redefining success through this expanded lens, Holmström challenges us to reimagine our social systems, policies, and personal priorities. The book presents not just an alternative metric, but a transformative path toward a world where measurement itself may one day become unnecessary—where love, meaning, connection, playfulness, freedom, and resilience are so deeply embedded in our way of life that they no longer need to be quantified.

Essential reading for policymakers, organizational leaders, community developers, and anyone seeking a more fulfilling approach to life in our measurement-obsessed world.
