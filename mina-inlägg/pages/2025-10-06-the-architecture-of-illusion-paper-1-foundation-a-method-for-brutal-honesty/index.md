_Establishing the Tools for a Clear-Eyed Critique of Our Dominant Systems_

## Overview

This foundational paper introduces the "Brutal Honesty" method - a rigorous framework for analyzing the systems that shape our lives. Moving beyond partisan debates, it provides the philosophical tools to examine capitalism, religion, and governance with equal parts clarity and compassion.

The paper establishes the core distinction between Absolute Truth (the unconditioned ideal) and Relative/Conventional Truth (the practical reality we navigate daily). It introduces a five-dimensional analytical framework and the disciplined practice of weighing systems' achievements against their pathologies without bias toward destruction or preservation.
