### **Core Mission:**

To conduct a rigorous, fair-minded dissection of capitalism using the "Brutal Honesty" method, practiced from a Yellow/Integral vantage point—holding multiple perspectives, seeing systemic patterns, and identifying developmental pathways forward. This paper will equally weigh the system's monumental achievements in driving innovation and lifting millions from poverty against its inherent pathologies—alienation, inequality, and ecological overshoot—judged against the ultimate criterion of reducing unnecessary suffering and expanding human flourishing. The goal is not to prescribe a single alternative or choose sides in old debates, but to expose the core illusion so we can consciously participate in, reform, or build beyond it—navigating the evolutionary transition catalyzed by the polycrisis. Throughout, a psycho-spiritual lens serves as a unifying throughline, revealing how capitalism's illusions distort not just material outcomes but also human meaning, identity, and inner life—giving deeper significance to the economic and ecological critiques without overshadowing them, while acknowledging that capitalism isn't designed for spiritual fulfillment but often undermines meaning-seeking in other domains through its encroachment on time, relationships, and values.
