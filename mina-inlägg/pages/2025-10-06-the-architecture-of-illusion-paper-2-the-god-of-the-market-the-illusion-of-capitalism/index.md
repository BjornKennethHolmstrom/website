_A Brutally Honest Autopsy of the World's Most Powerful Secular Religion_

## Overview

This paper applies the Brutal Honesty method to capitalism, examining it as the dominant economic philosophy of our time. Rather than taking sides in old debates, it conducts a fair-minded dissection of capitalism's monumental achievements and inherent pathologies.

The analysis reveals capitalism's core illusion: that market valuation mechanisms adequately capture all forms of value that matter for human flourishing. This fuels the dangerous secondary illusion that infinite growth equals human progress, with profound consequences for both material conditions and our inner lives.
