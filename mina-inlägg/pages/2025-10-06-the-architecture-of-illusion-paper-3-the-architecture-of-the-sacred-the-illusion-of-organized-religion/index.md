_A Brutally Honest Autopsy of Humanity's Quest for the Divine_

## Overview

This paper turns the Brutal Honesty lens toward organized religion, examining it as humanity's attempt to build structures around the uncontainable. It explores the fundamental tension between direct transcendent experience and the institutional frameworks designed to mediate it.

The analysis identifies religion's core illusion: the conflation of spiritual maps with transcendent territory. This manifests as the primacy of propositional belief - the notion that the Divine's existence depends on our mental assent, rather than being a reality to be perceived directly.
