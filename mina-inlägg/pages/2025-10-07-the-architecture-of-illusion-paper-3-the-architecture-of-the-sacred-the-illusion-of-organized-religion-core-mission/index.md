## **Core Mission**

To apply the "Brutal Honesty" method to organized religion, examining it as a human-built architecture designed to contain the uncontainable. This paper will equally weigh religion's profound contributions to meaning, morality, and community against its inherent pathologies of dogmatism, institutional corruption, and violence. The psycho-spiritual lens is central here, exploring the fundamental tension between direct transcendent experience and the institutional structures built to mediate it.

The goal is not to dismiss spirituality, but to distinguish the map from the territory, enabling a more conscious relationship with the sacred, whether within, outside, or alongside religious traditions. Building on the Two Truths framework and architectural analysis from Paper 1, this paper applies Brutal Honesty to organized religion as a system that mediates the Absolute through Relative structures.
