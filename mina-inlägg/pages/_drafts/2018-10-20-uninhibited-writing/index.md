some words on a paper

some symbols floating in empty space

ink flowing in lines

awareness rising

quantum fluctuations

infinite wisdom available

by just letting go

it all comes into place

sharpen my intuition

let me feel all joy

deeply deeply open my heart

calm my mind, don't fall apart

except in a peaceful manner, like eternal sleep

Universe

Earth                             ❤️

Sweden

Vallentuna

me @ my family's home

what is love?

what is life?

what is my purpose?

what is happiness?

the moment

the colors

the smells                                       opening up

the sounds

the touch

the experience
