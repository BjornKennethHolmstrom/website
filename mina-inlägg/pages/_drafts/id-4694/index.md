title: "Is the future vegan? — work in progress"
draft: true

You might have heard this saying "The Future Is Vegan". In this cross-field article we will investigate if it has a solid foundation by looking at statistics and using systems thinking.

To begin with, it is important to note that a system is only a model of reality and that no system exists completely enclosed, but is always part of a larger one. Were it enclosed, it would not be possible to observe, it would have no measurable inputs or outputs.  

## A note on the reasons for Controversy

To illustrate why there is contradictory evidence for and against various diets including or excluding animal products we present the following graph.

Outliers are the cases of diets which include any of the following properties 

- Extremely one-sided and thus nutritionally deficient  
    
- Include highly processed foods where nutrients no longer can be absorbed
- Have additives disruptive to the metabolic system. Even simple ones such as processed sugar, refined fat or salt.  
    

## Studies

### Health

AICR, the American Institute for Cancer Research lists foods that fight cancer. These are all vegan.  [http://www.aicr.org/foods-that-fight-cancer/](http://www.aicr.org/foods-that-fight-cancer/)

With a longer life span and little to no disease, vegan populations will simply adapt and survive better. As in any case of survival of the fittest, both individual vegans and vegan societies win out by having

- higher ethics / morale  
    
- less environmental impact
- lower food costs  
    

By simply being healthier \[\], vegans are happier and thus more attractive to other humans in general. Thus they are more likely to be employed in higher positions in organizations, especially new ones with less prejudice. As we have seen in numerous cases the last century, its either adapt and evolve or die out, both for governments and businesses in an increasingly globally interconnected world.  

It could be a matter of time before vegans start to become the majority in various populations. By looking at the similarity to other movements in history, such as the abolition of slavery, as soon as that happens, legislative action will probably occur that limit and even prohibit the use of animals in those areas. With today's advanced information technology and widespread surveillance it seems unlikely that illegal activity of animal farming on any larger scale will occur, although there is the possibility of smuggling during a transition period with only part of the global population living under new laws.  

### Populations

Here we look at some studies in large countries around the world. We choose a large time span to better indicate any trends  

### U.S.A.

The population of vegans seems to have risen from 0.9% in 2000, 1.3% in 2006, 1% in 2009, 3% in 2011, 1% in 2012, 1.6% in 2016. 

Note that the study from 2006 includes those occasionally eating honey as vegans, while this is not in accord with the strict definition of veganism.
