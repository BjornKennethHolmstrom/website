Today I was out in Stockholm the whole afternoon. I was asking a friend to come, but unfortunately didn't know she worked on the weekends! So I went about alone, which still was great. Passed by a book store, was happy to see at least a fifth of the cooking books were vegan! And went to the city library, read two pages in I Ching, the book of change.

At Goodstore on Södermalm I tried veganized Swedish food for the first time; instead of kaviar made by killing fish these were from kelp! And they also had the traditional Swedish bun with whipped cream called semla!

I'm so happy to see the world slowly changing to become more compassionate!

And grateful to come home to a clean modern flat again. The only gripe I have with it at the moment is the stove being a thermo-electric, which is 10 to 20 percent less energy efficient than the induction I had expected since the apartment was advertised as modern and eco-friendly.

Some thoughts on love and relationships...

It's been just over twenty years since I fell madly in love the first time and last time, something which lasted around two years. After she broke up I was looking for her to somehow magically come back and even when I went into the next relationship which lasted fifteen years. I still hadn't gotten over her. Not until I realized it was me that hadn't matured, I didn't value myself enough. Now I feel I am on the brink of being able to fall in love again, but instead of expecting a perfect person I think we can make love happen ourselves. This time I won't forget to love myself as much as the other person, it doesn't have to be a sacrifice one way or the other. I think it is something couples could do well to remind each other of, married or not.
