**Equipment**

- 1 cup
- 1 teaspoon

_Baking_

- Oven + baking pan
- 1 baking paper, the size of the baking pan

_Wrapping_

- Scissors
- 2 meters (6½ feet) of string

**Ingredients**

_Dry_

- ⅓ cup dried aroniaberries
- ⅓ cup dried blueberries
- ½ cup cashew nuts
- ⅓ cup sunflower seeds
- 2 tablespoons cacao powder
- 2 teaspoons chia seeds
- 2 teaspoons flax seeds
- 2 teaspoons minced hemp seeds

Can't find aroniaberries? Replace them with cranberries or gojiberries! The same goes for the seeds. Alternatives are sesame seeds

_Wet_

- ½ cup peanut butter
- 2 ripe bananas

**Preparation**

_Bars_

1. Put all the dry ingredients in a mixer and blend for a minute. Or chop the nuts with a knife and mix by hand![vegan-energy-bars-dry-mix](/creations/images/food/vegan-energy-bars-dry-mix.png)
2. Mash the bananas in a bowl, stir in the peanut butter and finally the dry mix![vegan-energy-bars-dry-wet-mixed](/creations/images/food/vegan-energy-bars-dry-wet-mixed.png)
3. Heat the oven to 175 C° (347 F°)
4. With clean hands, form rectangular bars. A size of 6 x 3 x 1.5 cm, or 2 x 1 x 0.5 inches should give around 16 bars
5. Bake the bars on the baking paper for 25 minutes ![vegan-energy-bars-baking](/creations/images/food/vegan-energy-bars-baking.png)
6. Take them out to cool down ![vegan-energy-bar-baked](/creations/images/food/vegan-energy-bar-baked.png)

 

_Wrapping_

1.  Cut each baking paper into eight pieces. A quick way is to roll each baking paper and cut each roll in four with three equidistant cuts, and then cut each of the resulting eight rolls in half along the length
2. Cut the string into 16 equally long pieces. A quick way to do this is to wrap the string eight turns, then stretch and cut along two opposite ends
3. Wrap the energy bars with the paper, and tie a string in a rosette around each one ![vegan-energy-bars-wrapped](/creations/images/food/vegan-energy-bars-wrapped.png)

_Storage_

The bars can be stored in a fridge for at least a week, and for a month in a freezer without losing their properties.

They can also be consumed right away if you have done more demanding exercise than just baking them!
