					gry: {
						title: 'Gry',
						description:
							'Gry was painted during a few weeks in September 2018, when I came back to Sweden after three years abroad. It depicts symbols for the awakening of consciousness. The crystals of primordial order. The Buddha, true knowledge embodied. Psychedelic mushrooms, hints to a mind outside the limited self. The cave itself is also symbolic: The cave of Plato which most people do not dare exit. The cave to which the hermit or spiritual seeker retreats to, until Truth is revealed.',
						materials: 'Materials used are ink brush, pencil, color pencil, crayon, pastel and acrylic.'
					},
					moonWish: {
						title: 'Moon Wish',
						description:
							"The idea for Moon Wish came in a dream. The dream was a brief visual flash and lasted less than a second, but I knew what it was immediately; It was the moon with life similar to the Earth! I felt the dream was a wish from the moon as it is now to be depicted with life. The next days I researched the moon’s geology by reading and making sketches. I wanted to get a grasp on the placement and shapes of the largest seas and craters. To stay true to the dream, I let the ecology balance to something stabler, but the desert area on the eastern side is a residue from considering this question. I kept the idea that rain clouds travel towards the unlit side due to day on the moon lasting half a month on Earth.",
						materials:
							'First I put down the shapes of the craters, seas and mountains using pencils. Then I created different zones with colored pencils. I blended the coloring with water, adding more geographical details with ink pens, colored brush ink pens and another round of colored pencils. I filled the dark space behind and made the outer atmosphere more vibrant with a black ink marker and smaller clouds and stars using white highlighter.'
					},
					owlsVision: {
						title: "Owl's Vision",
						description:
							"This artwork is part of a mixed media creation I have undertaken; writing a novel and creating art along with the continued expansion of game world b³O. The novel is a story of personal growth where people from a desert village in a disastrous state join inhabitants of a more well functioning community nearby to create a new home in a savanna, occasionally assisted by a mysterious stranger. The drawing shows the meeting between a gigantic owl and the stranger.",
						materials:
							'I used lead pencils for the general composition and rough sketch, then colored pencils for shades and textures and finally ink pens to fill in contours and create more contrast, giving the result a cartoony feel.'
					},
					acacianAscendancy: {
						title: 'Acacian Ascendancy',
						description:
							"This artwork is part of the same mixed media creation. As a first sketch of how the new home could look like, the area is a rough approximation of a place in the 3D-game Minecraft, and the result will probably differ a lot.",
						materials:
							'I used lead pencils for the initial layout, then ink pens to fill in contours and dark areas and finally colored pencils to give it more life.'
					},
					alia: {
						title: 'Alia and Shai-Hulud',
						description:
							'This artwork depicts a scene from the second novel in the Dune novel series by Frank Herbert, Dune Messiah.',
						materials:
							"I started with lead pencils for the composition and first outlines on standard college block paper. I set the general tones with layers of colored pencil and then accentuated contours and put in depth, contrasts and dark shadows with ink pens. I used a white highlighter for the scales, the hair of Alia and whirls of the sand. I highlighted the teeth with blue brush pens and made the sand more lively with a golden ink brush pen. I blended the pencil colors with a water brush pen."
					},
					mushroomClouds: {
						title: 'Mushroom Clouds',
						description:
							'I have a thing for re-purposing overgrown structures. There is an abandoned nuclear power plant not very far from where I live which inspired this creation. This chimney hosts someone who thought building a rickety structure on top of it would be worth the effort. Could it have been the great view over the forest that brought it forth? Or the extra sunlight, enough to grow grapes and other crops?',
						materials:
							'I used pencils to create an initial sketch, then ink pens for contours and darkness, and then colored pencils for the surfaces. I blended the colors with a water brush pen. Since the paper is very thin, it unfortunately created undulations, especially around the sky.'
					},
					gaia: {
						title: 'Gaia',
						description:
							"I drew Gaia just after getting this advice from a friend and artist: “‘You can study Michelangelo as much as you want, but when it comes to art, just forget everything”. I set out to draw a male character, but it ended up female. I also had the intention to make it happy, but it turned out crying, and I cried myself why drawing it. I felt this was a sorrow inside me connected to seeing the environment not being cared for and feeling inadequate to act. Gaia is our planet personified. The light bulb represents enlightenment, and my wish for more people to become more aware.",
						materials:
							'I used lead pencils for the contours and composition, then filled them in with ink pens. finally I colored with pencils and used a water brush pen to blend them. I also added some shades with lead pencil.'
					},
					amets: {
						title: 'Amets, Unai, Unai and Kimets',
						description:
							'Amets, Unai, Unai and Kimets were sitting on a bench outside on Kalbario square next to where I live. I asked if I could take a photograph to use for drawing practice. They were happy to participate. They looked directly at the camera at first, but I told them that I preferred if they acted just as they had before I approached them. I was amazed at how easily they did that! The drawing turned out pretty well, although I had trouble getting the features of one face right.. can you see which one?',
						materials:
							'I used lead pencil to draw an initial sketch to find the proportions. I filled in the contours with an thick ink pen to transfer the shapes to the paper in the picture above. There I traced the outlines and filled the darkest areas with ink pens. Then I added details. I finally colored with pencils and shaded with lead pencil and ink pens.'
					},
					landscape: {
						title: 'Landscape',
						description:
							'Sometimes I like to draw in a meditative way, without prior thoughts or preparations. I was listening to some talk from Jiddu Krishnamurti or Alan Watts while drawing this.',
						materials: 'I started with only ink pen, and some time later decided to fill in colors with pencils.'

Let me see what those can share
Who are beyond the carnal care
I have got this fatal flair
Of involvement in the world's affairs
But briefly catching glimpses I
of that which outside inside lie

Ideas to take away the towers
Ideas to cover worlds with flowers
Ideas that come from unknown powers
Ideas to awaken sleeping cowards

More gamma than Buddhas dhamma
More concrete than a one-way street

but I do dig your clatter

Heron in river
your grace makes me shiver
and stop on my way
Do you meditate, pray?

Cow on the peak
won't be nobody's steak
I will teach her to fly
or my tears will run dry

Horses and sheep
you'll all make me weep
if your life is to end
for some ignorant friend

Alley cat sneaking
I look at you peeking
unto evening's litter
a feast all too bitter

Dogs in long leashes
peeing where pleases
dragging 'round 'masters'
out of disasters

Frogs in the night
Town's singing delight
got their own fanzine
for their choral routine

Bat under roof
Mysterious, aloof
Your silent wings flap
when flying your laps

Spider in corner
is not a mourner
when I clean in a gown
and its net gather down

Butterfly fluttering
won't hear me muttering
how its catering nephews
ate all my lettuce

Heartshaped little fly
buzzing near me and by
there's no swatter here
for you, dear, to fear

Silverfish glimmer
in stark lamp light (no dimmer)
you make me gladder
as I empty my bladder`

Grab a can of Monster juice

					body: `Confident, the flyer gazed across the landscape, perched as it was on the biggest branch of Flower Valley’s Life Tree, next to the deep light blue crystal sonorizing any access of the oaken chest. The chest stored diamonds accumulated by Esh, the legendary miner and gem cutter, who every day expanded and extended excavations mostly around the caverns and tunnels nesting further down than even the towering tree’s roots.

Across the horizon from the northwest, a sudden blinking light appeared: a disc smooth as molten metal running across the sky, suddenly stopping at the savanna heights.

With eyes as wide as the round doors of the underground dwelling of Azu, Vin, Kin, and Kam, the giant grey leaned forth without astonishment or awe but with awakened curiosity. It extended its wings with a drawn-out wooosh, brushing and fanning them hundredfold aside to swoop up and away. Ascending almost vertically at first and then embracing the warm incoming air, it glided, casting a shadow covering the narrow pass from the barren granite cliff to the sheep-grazed, oaky cone-shaped hill marking the natural border between the inhabited valley and beyond.

Increasing speed, the usually nocturnal feathered fellow flew forward, focused on the flickering ahead. Closing in, it saw a funny figure climbing the rocks, planting foreign fruits. Compelled to land, they met, one seven times as tall as the other.

The stranger sang, no words but the meaning was of pure joy, yet so profound it seemed to make the fruits grow, and grow they did; in seconds only, stalks swirled soaring, stretching sinewy strands, exploding in further fruit.

With orange hair, a green cape, shirt, and trousers, blue eyes, and a silver necklace with a jade heart, the anonymous one spoke: “Fruits. Forget to remember.” It took a bit of purple-white pulp in its mouth and was gone.

Qal blinked, relaxed his shoulders. Images, yet blurry in his mind, appeared of seven persons. Certainty was of their need — as he flew back to Flower Valley, it was time to assist the newcomers.`

For a moment, all was still, and then a sudden splash, a crack of a branch, and the figure had leapt into the stream snaking its way across the dense jungle, occasionally widening to the size of a smaller lake. A fast swimmer, this figure with thick long dark brown hair and a blue-green cloth wrapped around her torso quickly approached the border of the jungle opening up to a grassy plain strewn with daffodils, peonies, and poppies. Carrying a bag of some sort, this tall woman with strong legs now sprinted over the hills, scattering wild horses and sheep as she passed them by, securely tracing a path only visible in her mind.

In the horizon, behind four flowery hills rose an enormous tree, oak-like in shape but with gleaming colorful crystals among its branches. Below the hills lay a lake system with lily ponds and leaping fish.

The woman also leapt, across a narrowing at least seven meters across, quickly continued up the slopes, and into a crevasse of a cave. Not a natural one, or at least only partly so, this cave reeked of old ruin blended with something recent and fresh, as if renovated.

Meeting a man in a hood, she exchanged a fleeting moment of words and the container changed hands. Wasting no time, the bare-footed woman tripped up a spiral staircase into a large long hall with face-like illuminated formations for openings on each end and frescoes of landscapes in contrasting direct and reflected light respectively on opposite walls.

Out of the hall, a balcony revealed the majestic tree in full, at least a hundred meters both tall and wide. Taking no heed of the scene, Azu outlined an overview of the day’s explored areas onto a map on the wall with colored charcoal.`

					title: 'Valley Visitors',
					body: `A valley opened up before them, full of flowers of all colors. In the middle, a giant tree stretched its wide branches out in all directions, shadowing parts of the various small buildings underneath it. In the distant corner of the valley, small lakes gathered the water streaming down along the hillside. There was a waterfall from the upper part of the trunk of the giant tree, and another waterfall from the low mountains across the valley to the west.

Plantations of grain and vegetables were scattered along the streams and lakes. They also surrounded the mouth of the bay leading in between the steep cliffs covering the river to the south, leaving only a narrow peek towards distant grassy plains.

North of the mammoth tree stood a 3-story building with a large green crystal on its roof. The first floor extended in two directions, creating balconies on both sides of the second. The roof of the third floor was deeply slanted. Next to the house was a well, which strangely had flickering light shining up from it.

Up to the left lay an overgrown wooden cabin, made from fallen tree trunks. Up on the hill were grass-covered mounds. The cabin had small openings surrounded by old planks where light shone into the subterranean interior. A thin trail of smoke ran from one of the holes in the roof.

“That’s where I live,” said Ope. “It doesn’t look anything like Fer’s fancy house, but I love it. A bed, a place to lay down my axe, store tree saplings, and a fireplace is all I need. Now let’s go see if Est is around.”

They walked forward towards the large central tree, passing palm trees that looked like small ferns or flimsy flowers in comparison. Then they took a left towards the south. A flat green building extended out from the inside of the enormous tree trunk to their right, and another rickety house lay on their left, just below the hill where Ope had his home.`

								q: 'Where did you get the ideas for the map?',
								a: "Ḍādxièya was originally just my main personal creative world, a place to build whatever I felt inspired to build. But as I built a few things I eventually I yearned for a way to travel more quickly between locations.\nAlthough I could use the /tp command, I wanted to try out command blocks.\nI also wanted a nice overview of where I had built things. Thus I created the teleportation map. I didn’t want to disturb the builds, so I hid the command blocks, integrating their method of activation into the environment."
							},
							{
								q: 'Where did you get the ideas for the builds?',
								a: "Most of the builds are built purely from imagination, but some have external sources:\n• The Buddhist temple is inspired by the Tiger’s Nest or Paro Taktsang monastery in Tibet {wikiLink}.\n• Ideas for the Japanese village and house came partly from a book from 1889 by Edward S. Morse. It is 418 pages of detailed descriptions along with beautiful illustrations. It doesn’t show up if you just google ‘Japanese architecture’, so it is a bit of a hidden gem. HTML, Kindle, EPUB, pdf and text of the book are available at {gutenbergLink}, but when I built the houses I used {browseLink} which I find more easy to browse and read than for example the pdf.\n• Quotes and poems on signs come from a variety of sources, and are hopefully all correctly attributed in-game. Text authored by myself is usually unsigned."
							},
							{
								q: 'What does the name mean?',
								a: "Ḍādxièya is how the characters ꕩ䪥ﺿ are pronounced. Read from the right to the left, the name consists of one Arabic, one Chinese character and one Vai glyph. I’d like to think of it as a symbol for a dream of a united world without borders, where cultural and national identities no longer play any significant roles. It can also be seen as a prototype idea for how a our different languages might soon be morphed into a common language read and spoken by everyone on Earth. It would of course be more blended, with the different scripts no longer as readily distinguishable, but still. It was created by taking the world seed as decimals, converting it into binary and then into unicode."

					"Have you ever wondered why nearly every major cultural and religious tradition speaks of a profound shift in human consciousness – a state of complete understanding or awakening? From Buddhist *bodhi* to Hindu *moksha*, from Christian illumination to Zoroastrian *ushta*, these traditions point to something remarkable about human potential.",
				universalTitle: 'A Universal Human Experience?',
				universalBody: `What’s fascinating is that these descriptions of enlightenment emerge independently across cultures and times:

* Buddhism: *bodhi*, *kensho*, *satori*
* Hinduism: *moksha* (liberation)
* Jainism: *Kevala Jnana*
* Christianity: illumination, kenosis, metanoia
* Zoroastrianism: *ushta*

This convergence raises intriguing questions:
– What if these traditions are describing a real human capacity?
– Could there be aspects of consciousness we haven’t fully explored?
– What might we discover by investigating this ourselves?`,

Jag kände att drömmen var en önskan från månen som den är nu att bli avbildad med liv. Dagarna efter forskade jag om månens geologi genom att läsa och göra skisser. Jag ville få grepp om placeringen och formerna på de största haven och kratrarna. För att vara trogen drömmen lät jag ekologin balansera till något stabilare, men ökenområdet på den östra sidan är en rest från att ha övervägt denna fråga.

Ideas to take away the towers
Ideas to cover worlds with flowers

Heron in river
your grace makes me shiver

Do you meditate, pray?

Cow on the peak
won't be nobody's steak
I will teach her to fly
or my tears will run dry

Horses and sheep
you'll all make me weep
if your life is to end
for some ignorant friend

Alley cat sneaking
I look at you peeking
unto evening's litter
a feast all too bitter

Dogs in long leashes
peeing where pleases
dragging 'round 'masters'
out of disasters

Frogs in the night
Town's singing delight
got their own fanzine
for their choral routine

Bat under roof
Mysterious, aloof
Your silent wings flap
when flying your laps

Spider in corner
is not a mourner
when I clean in a gown
and its net gather down

Butterfly fluttering
won't hear me muttering
how its catering nephews
ate all my lettuce

Heartshaped little fly
buzzing near me and by
there's no swatter here
for you, dear, to fear

Silverfish glimmer
in stark lamp light (no dimmer)
you make me gladder

					body: `Självsäkert blickade flygaren ut över landskapet, sittandes på den största grenen av Blomsterdalens Livsträd, bredvid den djupa ljusblå kristallen som ljudligt markerade all åtkomst till ekkistan. Kistan förvarade diamanter samlade av Esh, den legendariska gruvarbetaren och juvelsliparen, som varje dag utökade och förlängde utgrävningar mestadels runt grottorna och tunnlarna som låg ännu djupare än till och med det väldiga trädets rötter.

Vid horisonten i nordväst dök ett plötsligt blinkande ljus upp: en skiva slät som smält metall som for över himlen, och som plötsligt stannade vid savannens höjder.

Med ögon så vida som de runda dörrarna till Azus, Vins, Kins och Kams underjordiska boning, lutade sig den jättelika grå varelsen framåt, inte med förvåning eller vördnad, utan med väckt nyfikenhet. Den sträckte ut sina vingar med ett utdraget svooosh, slog dem hundrafalt åt sidan för att störta upp och iväg. Den steg nästan vertikalt till en början och omfamnade sedan den varma inkommande luften, och gled, kastande en skugga som täckte det smala passet från den karga granitklippan till den fårbetade, ekbevuxna konformade kullen som utgjorde den naturliga gränsen mellan den bebodda dalen och världen utanför.

Med ökande hastighet flög den vanligtvis nattliga bevingade varelsen framåt, fokuserad på flimret framför sig. När den närmade sig såg den en lustig figur som klättrade på klipporna, planterandes främmande frukter. Tvingad att landa möttes de, den ena sju gånger så hög som den andra.

Främlingen sjöng, inga ord men meningen var av ren glädje, men ändå så djup att den verkade få frukterna att växa, och växa gjorde de; på bara några sekunder virvlade stjälkar uppåt, sträckte ut seniga rankor och exploderade i ytterligare frukt.

Med orange hår, en grön kappa, skjorta och byxor, blå ögon och ett silverhalsband med ett jadehjärta, talade den anonyma: ”Frukter. Glöm att minnas.” Den tog lite lila-vitt fruktkött i munnen och var borta.

Qal blinkade, slappnade av i axlarna. Bilder, ännu suddiga i hans sinne, dök upp av sju personer. Vissheten om deras behov var tydlig — när han flög tillbaka till Blomsterdalen var det dags att hjälpa de nyanlända.`

				remedy: {
					title: 'Botemedelsruschen',
					body: `I rännilen av dagg som samlades längs lianerna stod den allvarliga gestalten, lång, hypnotiserad av ljuset som spelade bland löven på grenarna högt under en himmel färgad i rosa och orange, med strömmar av gråvita moln som vältrade sig och vecklades ut. För ett ögonblick var allt stilla, och sedan ett plötsligt plask, ett knakande från en gren, och gestalten hade hoppat i strömmen som slingrade sig fram genom den täta djungeln, och som ibland vidgades till storleken av en mindre sjö. Denna gestalt, en snabb simmare med tjockt långt mörkbrunt hår och ett blågrönt tygstycke virat runt bålen, närmade sig snabbt djungelns gräns som öppnade upp mot en grässlätt beströdd med påskliljor, pioner och vallmo.

Bärandes på en väska av något slag sprang nu denna långa kvinna med starka ben över kullarna, skingrande vildhästar och får när hon passerade dem, medan hon säkert följde en stig som bara var synlig i hennes sinne.

Vid horisonten, bakom fyra blommiga kullar, reste sig ett enormt träd, ekliknande i formen men med glimmande färgglada kristaller bland grenarna. Nedanför kullarna låg ett sjösystem med näckrosdammar och hoppande fiskar.

Kvinnan hoppade också, över en avsmalning på minst sju meter, fortsatte snabbt uppför sluttningarna och in i en spricka i en grotta. Inte en naturlig grotta, eller åtminstone bara delvis, denna grotta stank av gammal ruin blandat med något nytt och fräscht, som om den renoverats.

Hon mötte en man i huva, utbytte några flyktiga ord och behållaren bytte händer. Utan att slösa någon tid skyndade den barfota kvinnan uppför en spiraltrappa in i en stor lång sal med ansiktsliknande upplysta formationer som öppningar i varje ände och fresker av landskap i kontrasterande direkt respektive reflekterat ljus på motstående väggar.

Ut från salen avslöjade en balkong det majestätiska trädet i sin helhet, minst hundra meter både högt och brett. Utan att fästa någon vikt vid utsikten skissade Azu upp en översikt över dagens utforskade områden på en karta på väggen med färgat kol.`

				valley: {
					title: 'Dalens besökare',
					body: `En dal öppnade sig framför dem, full av blommor i alla färger. I mitten sträckte ett jättelikt träd ut sina breda grenar i alla riktningar och skuggade delar av de olika små byggnaderna under det. I dalens bortre hörn samlade små sjöar upp vattnet som strömmade ner längs bergssidan. Det fanns ett vattenfall från den övre delen av det jättelika trädets stam, och ett annat vattenfall från de låga bergen tvärs över dalen i väster.

Odlingar av säd och grönsaker låg utspridda längs bäckarna och sjöarna. De omgav också mynningen av viken som ledde in mellan de branta klipporna som dolde floden i söder, och lämnade bara en smal glimt mot avlägsna grässlätter.

Norr om det enorma trädet stod en 3-våningsbyggnad med en stor grön kristall på taket. Den första våningen sträckte sig ut i två riktningar och skapade balkonger på båda sidor om den andra. Taket på tredje våningen var kraftigt sluttande. Bredvid huset fanns en brunn, från vilken det konstigt nog sken ett flimrande ljus.

Uppe till vänster låg en övervuxen timmerstuga, gjord av fallna trädstammar. Uppe på kullen fanns gräsbevuxna kullar. Stugan hade små öppningar omgivna av gamla plankor där ljus sken in i den underjordiska interiören. En tunn strimma rök steg från ett av hålen i taket.

”Där bor jag”, sa Ope. ”Det liknar inte alls Fers flådiga hus, men jag älskar det. En säng, en plats att lägga ner min yxa, förvara trädplantor och en öppen spis är allt jag behöver. Låt oss nu gå och se om Est är i närheten.”

De gick framåt mot det stora centrala trädet och passerade palmer som i jämförelse såg ut som små ormbunkar eller bräckliga blommor. Sedan tog de vänster söderut. En platt grön byggnad sträckte sig ut från insidan av den enorma trädstammen till höger om dem, och ett annat skrangligt hus låg till vänster, precis nedanför kullen där Ope hade sitt hem.`

								q: 'Var fick du idéerna till kartan ifrån?',
								a: 'Ḍādxièya var ursprungligen bara min personliga kreativa huvudvärld, en plats att bygga vad jag än kände mig inspirerad att bygga. Men när jag byggt några saker längtade jag så småningom efter ett sätt att resa snabbare mellan platserna.\nÄven om jag kunde använda /tp-kommandot ville jag testa kommandoblock.\nJag ville också ha en bra överblick över var jag hade byggt saker. Därför skapade jag teleporteringskartan. Jag ville inte störa byggena, så jag gömde kommandoblocken och integrerade deras aktiveringsmetod i miljön.'
							},
							{
								q: 'Var fick du idéerna till byggnaderna ifrån?',
								a: 'De flesta byggena är byggda enbart från fantasin, men vissa har externa källor:\n• Det buddhistiska templet är inspirerat av Tigerns näste eller Paro Taktsang-klostret i Tibet {wikiLink}.\n• Idéer till den japanska byn och huset kom delvis från en bok från 1889 av Edward S. Morse. Den består av 418 sidor med detaljerade beskrivningar tillsammans med vackra illustrationer. Den dyker inte upp om man bara googlar "japansk arkitektur", så den är lite av en gömd pärla. HTML, Kindle, EPUB, pdf och text av boken finns tillgängliga på {gutenbergLink}, men när jag byggde husen använde jag {browseLink} som jag tycker är lättare att bläddra i och läsa än till exempel pdf:en.\n• Citat och dikter på skyltar kommer från en mängd olika källor, och är förhoppningsvis alla korrekt attribuerade i spelet. Text skriven av mig själv är vanligtvis osignerad.'

							{
								q: 'Vad betyder namnet?',
								a: 'Ḍādxièya är hur tecknen ꕩ䪥ﺿ uttalas. Läst från höger till vänster består namnet av ett arabiskt, ett kinesiskt tecken och en Vai-glyf. Jag vill gärna se det som en symbol för en dröm om en enad värld utan gränser, där kulturella och nationella identiteter inte längre spelar någon betydande roll. Det kan också ses som en prototypidé för hur våra olika språk snart kan omvandlas till ett gemensamt språk som läses och talas av alla på jorden. Det skulle naturligtvis vara mer blandat, där de olika skriftsystemen inte längre är lika lätta att urskilja, men ändå. Det skapades genom att ta världens "seed" (seed) som decimaltal, omvandla det till binärt och sedan till unicode.'

			 intro:
				 'Har du någonsin undrat varför nästan varje större kulturell och religiös tradition talar om ett djupt skifte i mänskligt medvetande – ett tillstånd av fullständig förståelse eller uppvaknande? Från buddhistisk *bodhi* till hinduisk *moksha*, från kristen illumination till zoroastrisk *ushta*, pekar dessa traditioner på något anmärkningsvärt om mänsklig potential.',
			 universalTitle: 'En Universell Mänsklig Erfarenhet?',
			 universalBody: `Det fascinerande är att dessa beskrivningar av upplysning dyker upp oberoende av varandra över kulturer och tider:

* Buddhism: *bodhi*, *kensho*, *satori*
* Hinduism: *moksha* (befrielse)
* Jainism: *Kevala Jnana*
* Kristendom: illumination, kenosis, metanoia
* Zoroastrianism: *ushta*

Denna konvergens väcker spännande frågor:
– Tänk om dessa traditioner beskriver en verklig mänsklig förmåga?
– Kan det finnas aspekter av medvetandet vi inte helt har utforskat?
– Vad skulle vi kunna upptäcka genom att undersöka detta själva?`,
