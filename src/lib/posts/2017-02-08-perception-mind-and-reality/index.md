If one stays for long enough time in a focused awareness on any one perception of the present, there arises a perception of the absence of everything else.

Something which is discovered, after searching deeply, is

There are no actual borders in reality!

This can be found in many ways, for example through persistently seeking the most accurate information, or by persistently trying to discover what is the unifying connection between different concepts, by meditation with the goal of experiencing non-duality, or even by stumbling upon it. We can see in science that any measurement of anything ultimately comes from an agreement of a model of reality. Equally so in religion. Any faith comes from accepting an original statement. In this, we understand that there is actually no conflict between religion and science, since both has to start with a statement/belief that is taken as truth. Now before you might say that science is the method of drawing conclusion based on facts, ask yourself, where did those facts come from?

Some interesting conclusions can be drawn from the absence of actual borders in reality is that many things taken for granted, does not exist in the reality outside of the realm of thought:

- There is no time in reality.

- There are no separate spatial dimensions.

The concepts of time and space only exist as a reoccurring and thus reinforcing experience through the interpretation of the mind. This might seem mind-boggling, but please stay with me.

The personal experience of the universe in each moment can be seen as a function of an enormous structure of interconnected partial structures, where the core stays seemingly fixed, with an emphasis on seemingly. That core part contains among other things the separation between time, space in inner and outer perceptions. But these are also interwoven without any actual border. The experience of there being borders were formed during "earlier" parts of our existence. These borders and the patterns they delimit are mutually arising, they cannot exist without each other in the form they are perceived. Note however, that these statements of course, form another limiting model.
