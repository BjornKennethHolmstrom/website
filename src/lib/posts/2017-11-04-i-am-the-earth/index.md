I am the Earth

I people myself

I am the most beautiful spaceship you might ever see

I spin and dance around a star

to get evenly shone

I tilt in my spinning dance

to give everyone the chance

to see the colours of seasons

to have plenty of reasons

to count years and to sing

at the arrival of spring

you walk my crust

you are child of my dust

but I say that you must

not stay, nay, I trust

you to set out a course

to explore life in force

the outside of me

stars everywhere you can see

take care of me

like I care for you

and make love be

all you can see

in this galaxy
