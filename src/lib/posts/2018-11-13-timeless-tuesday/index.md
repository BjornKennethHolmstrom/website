Results from a Halloween competition on Planet Minecraft. The build I created, a pumpkin house in a 4-biome joint point got place 16 out of 56 submitted entries. Here is how [my entry](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/pumkpin-house-in-4-biome-joint-point/) looked like:

The highest score it got was on concept & originality, 42 out of 100. The other scores were technique & execution, on which it got 34, and it got 35 on presentation.  
Here is how it looked like after adding a bit more (after the competition)
