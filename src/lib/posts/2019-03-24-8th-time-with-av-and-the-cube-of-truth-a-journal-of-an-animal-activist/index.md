Since the beginning of February this year I have been volunteering for [Anonymous for the Voiceless.](https://www.anonymousforthevoiceless.org/) AV as it is often called in short, is an animal rights movement which organize weekly events in cities all around the world.

The activists are divided in two parts, one group forms a Cube of Truth, which are made up by people standing in a square formation holding either a sign or a device showing footage from the animal industry. The other activists are ready to engage bystanders in conversations around what is displayed.
