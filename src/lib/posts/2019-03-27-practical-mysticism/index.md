I listened to parts of two audio-books on my phone today: _[Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays](https://librivox.org/mysticism-and-logic-and-other-essays-by-bertrand-russell/)_ [by Bertrand Russell](https://librivox.org/mysticism-and-logic-and-other-essays-by-bertrand-russell/) and _[The Mystic Will](https://librivox.org/the-mystic-will-by-charles-godfrey-leland/)_ [by Charles Godfrey Leland](https://librivox.org/the-mystic-will-by-charles-godfrey-leland/). In the first book Russell points out that modern physics assumes existence to be a-causal. No cause is needed for example to describe how planets move by the laws of gravity.  
The a-causal nature of existence is missed by parts of culture and society.
