Here's are the photos I took along a walk today.

The first one is from the forest. I like it because of the green moss. I had some other opportunities for photographs as well, but didn't use them. Maybe another day!

On the way home I spotted the first tree I've seen this year growing leaves.

Nearby were also these, which moved magically in the wind.

Finally a very common sign of spring here in Sweden, grey willow with a pine behind

Now I will have a green tea with lemon.
