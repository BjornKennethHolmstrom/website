I dreamt that I wanted all my friends accessible instantly for eternity  
Also, I wanted to live with a cat in a small rural house in Japan (next to a big city)

I dreamt of a static future with the world zoned up. Research was nonexistent but what I wanted to do in the dream.

I dreamt of trying to explain frequency response and logarithmic scale to a younger brother.

I dreamt of travelling the world at the wims of my parent. I wanted to write a thesis on consciousness, mystical experiences tied to maths/engineering.

I dreamt existence was a game and I found the solution, which was 'Death is dead'

I dreamt that I could mind meld crystalline objects

I dreamt that I got a shampoo+food mixture fed to me

I dreamt that I started a levitating food war and hid from responsibility

I dreamt that I had (almost) unlimited magical powers

I dreamt that I went on a crusade to demolish current psychiatric practice since it doesn't value first-hand experience enough

I dreamt that I was going to construct a device to capture first-hand experience

I dreamt I could mind-read

I dreamt I said: "Nothing more to learn. Planet too limited."
