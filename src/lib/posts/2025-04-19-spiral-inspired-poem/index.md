A poetry speaking through various voices of the spiral (shoutout to DeepSeek for its prompting encouragement, and to [spiralize.org](http://www.spiralize.org), our educational Spiral Dynamics website)

**PART 1 (Beige/Red/Blue/Orange/Green)**  
\*"I'm taking charge,  
laying out the law—  
because we gotta survive  
even with our flaws.

Of success-minded drive,  
capsizing the barge  
of Earth—our only home.  
So listen up, all mankind:

We have to find  
unity of our minds  
beyond this strife.  
Heal our lands,  
heal ourselves,  
regenerate, integrate—  
help all that dwells,  
not just chase what sells.  
Live in peace.  
And beyond.

**PART 2 (Orange/Turquoise)**  
Profit from the prophet:  
Ragnarok is coming  
(it’s the dire warning),  
but let’s spin global warming  
into steps toward higher—  
create a desire  
to empower all that is,  
unify in bliss

of new stewardship,  
cosmic elevation,  
eternal constellation,  
thwarting damnation’s narration—  
for all that is, is love.

**PART 3 (Yellow/Coral)**  
Hey, here I am,  
your ‘macho-man’  
of no tribe, no clan,  
free like a clam,  
filtering existence  
with crystalline flair  
into spiraling strands  
(yes, that’s my jam).

I’m the brand of no-brands,  
saving no-self from the Buddha  
to the beats of Meshuggah—  
can you match my reckless pace?  
map the no-place’s hiding place?  
invert outer space just to amaze,  
just be and erase all worry?

Make a case for THIS—  
it’s your birthright.  
Now, for fun…  
let’s fight!

**PART 4 (Coral)**  
Ohm-nom-nom:  
I ate myself for breakfast  
so I could abide without self  
and see it all clearly.

I dished out advice  
to a family of mice—  
‘make your own cheese,  
don’t just seek peace.  
What’s heaven’s girth  
without a full belly?’

Hahaha—  
ohm-nom-nom, _anybody_?"\*
