### **The Activist's Zazen: A Crisis of Two Worlds**

Have you ever been in a strategy meeting, passionately advocating for a solution, and suddenly felt a strange disconnect? On the one hand, the urgency is real; the world's problems demand action. On the other, the "us vs. them" energy in the room—the battle of egos, the attachment to being _right_—feels like a symptom of the very consciousness that created the problems we're trying to solve. This is the activist's paradox: how do we fight for a better world without recreating the patterns of conflict and separation we seek to heal?

### **The Universal Principle: Reality Doesn't Do Ownership**

The key to bridging this gap lies in a profound, yet simple, insight. It crystallized for me during a recent conversation with an AI, starting with the thought: **"reality as an is-ness is indifferent to the state of ownership of things in our minds"**.

This isn't just a philosophical idea; it's the core of non-dual wisdom. The universe doesn't recognize our mental labels of "mine" and "yours." The idea of possession is a human fabrication, a story our minds tell to feel secure. The separate "self" that seeks to own things is an illusion, a temporary pattern like a wave that was never truly separate from the ocean. This isn't a call to inaction, but the foundation for a more intelligent and effective way of engaging with the world.

### **Practical Implications: So, How Does This Change Anything?**

If we take this insight seriously, it moves from an abstract concept to a powerful operational principle. It provides a practical bridge between seeing the world differently and acting in it differently.

- **From "My Idea" to "Our Best Outcome."** In a team meeting, the focus shifts from defending "my" idea to discovering the best collective solution. The ego's need to be right dissolves, opening up space for true collaboration and emergent wisdom.

- **From Blame to Systemic Analysis.** When a conflict arises in a community or organization, the impulse to find someone to blame is replaced by the question, "What is the underlying systemic issue that is causing this friction?" This shifts the focus from personal animosity to collective problem-solving.

- **From Ownership to Stewardship.** The logic of extraction collapses. If you see the forest, the river, or the atmosphere as inseparable from yourself, exploiting it for short-term gain becomes an act of self-harm. This naturally gives rise to a model of **stewardship**—caring for a shared inheritance.

### **Addressing the Skeptics**

This is where many idealistic approaches fall apart. Let's tackle the tough questions head-on.

- **"Isn't this just spiritual bypassing?"**  
    No. Spiritual bypassing is using spiritual concepts to _avoid_ dealing with real-world problems. This is the opposite. It's using a deeper understanding of reality to engage with those problems more effectively and sustainably, without the burnout and infighting that plagues so many movements.

- **"How do you get powerful people to adopt this?"**  
    You don't, not directly. You design systems where acting from an interconnected perspective is the most logical and rewarding path. You create economic and social structures that incentivize cooperation and stewardship over hoarding and extraction. The goal isn't to convert every CEO, but to change the game they're all playing in.

- **"How is this different?"**  
    Most idealistic approaches try to impose a new set of morals onto the existing, broken system. This approach focuses on changing the underlying "operating system" itself—the rules, incentives, and structures—to reflect a more accurate understanding of reality.

### **Real-World Application: A Blueprint for a Non-Dual World**

This isn't just theory. The **[Global Governance Frameworks](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/)** I work on are, in many ways, an attempt to build this perspective into the architecture of our global systems.

- The [**Treaty for Our Only Home**](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home) is a blueprint for global **stewardship**, designed to manage our shared commons.

- [Frameworks for **Indigenous Governance**](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge) honor worldviews that have always operated from a place of deep interconnection.

- Economic models like the **[Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)](https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/adaptive-universal-basic-income-a-new-social-contract-for-the-21st-century/)** are designed to dissolve the "us vs. them" mentality of resource hoarding by guaranteeing a security floor for everyone.

These are not just policies; they are expressions of a different way of seeing, designed for a world where we recognize we were never separate to begin with.

### **Conclusion: Your First Step**

Bridging the gap between our inner and outer worlds is the critical work of our time. True systems change requires a change in consciousness, and a change in consciousness is only meaningful if it changes how we act.

So here is the invitation: don't just ponder this as an idea. **Apply it.**

The next time you find yourself in a moment of conflict, disagreement, or "us vs. them" thinking—at work, in your community, or with family—pause and ask yourself one question: _"What would I do right now if I knew, for a fact, that we were not separate?"_

Let the answer guide your next move. That is how we begin to build a new world.

### **A Note on Frameworks**

The shift in perspective described in this post—from solving problems _within_ a system to redesigning the system itself—is a recognized stage in human development. For those interested in a formal model for this kind of thinking, the "integral" framework of **Spiral Dynamics** is a valuable resource. The worldview explored here aligns with what the model calls **Stage Yellow**—a move towards flexible, systemic, and interconnected thought.
