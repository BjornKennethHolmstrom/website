I've published a new white paper: "Beyond the Duopoly: A Playbook for Post-Polarized Politics." The paper diagnoses political polarization as a systems failure across three levels—electoral rules, civic culture, and decision-making processes—and proposes practical interventions including Community Solutions Labs and the Paradox Decision Canvas.

You can read it online or download the PDF from the new White Papers section under Resources.

I've also simplified the website structure, removing several inactive projects that weren't getting attention and streamlining the navigation. The focus is now on the work I'm either actively developing or that has produced something tangible rather than maintaining placeholder pages for dormant ideas.

The white paper represents a synthesis of thinking about democratic renewal that's been developing over the past year. While it addresses large-scale challenges, the emphasis is on actionable approaches that civic entrepreneurs and community leaders can implement locally.

For those interested in the methodology behind the Paradox Canvas, there's an interactive version available that walks through the four-step process for finding integrative solutions to divisive issues.
