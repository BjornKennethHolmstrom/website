The way we treat our land often mirrors how we treat our minds. We see a 'weed' like a thistle and rush to eliminate it. But an ecologist sees the thistle as a messenger—its presence indicates compacted soil, a specific mineral deficiency. The thistle, with its deep taproot, is the land's own attempt to heal itself.

I wonder if we can see **depression in a similar light**. What if it's not just a chemical malfunction to be suppressed, but a profound signal from our entire being—a 'psychological thistle'? It often appears when our lives are 'compacted' by chronic stress, our 'nutrients' depleted by a lack of meaning or connection. The withdrawal, the pain, the inertia—could this be the psyche's drastic attempt to force a shutdown, to redirect energy toward a necessary, deep-rooted healing?

This isn't to say tools like antidepressants don't have a place. Sometimes, the 'weeds' are so overwhelming we need to mow them back just to survive and access the 'soil.' But if we only ever mow and never listen to the message—if we don't aerate the compacted parts of our lives, address our nutritional deficits of soul and spirit—we risk treating the symptom while the underlying condition worsens. Perhaps the path forward is to learn to listen to our inner landscapes with the wisdom of an ecologist, not just the urgency of a groundskeeper.
