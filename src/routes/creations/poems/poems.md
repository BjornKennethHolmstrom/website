7.13 and up since four

7.13 and up since four
cold feet and bent back
bread and lentils in belly
my farts are really smelly
but my joy is out of bounds

---

A consciousness which is me and not me

A consciousness which is me and not me
I oscillate within it
Finding no stable ground, no longer trying to stand
I let it fling me into the unknown

---

Ascendant Ambiguity Access

What's the point of being with the in-people
if not so that when you come back out
you have reached another level
and can teach what it's all about

Take me to the mystics meeting
in this instant, however fleeting
I've got all this time to spare
Let me see what those can share
Who are beyond the carnal care
I have got this fatal flair
Of involvement in the world's affairs
But briefly catching glimpses I
of that which outside inside lie

Ideas to take away the towers
Ideas to cover worlds with flowers
Ideas that come from unknown powers
Ideas to awaken sleeping cowards

More meta than the meta-metas
More theta than the alpha betas
More gamma than Buddhas dhamma
More concrete than a one-way street

Here we reside.
Here we abide.

---

am I exhausted?

Am I exhausted?
Then let me be
like a barren tree
on desert sand

The last drop of water
of a cement cylinder
I swear, yet
my mouth is sealed

---

an infinitude of possible lives

An infinitude of possible lives tug my mind
flashing by in milliseconds
Memories of pasts remade, revisited, reformed

---

around town

Grasshopper in shower
show me the power
of a magical life
forgotten in strife

Blackbirds skipping
while I am tripping
direct me toward
the greatest reward

Storks on the tower
come as spring flowers
I don't mean to flatter
but I do dig your clatter

Heron in river
your grace makes me shiver
and stop on my way
Do you meditate, pray?

Cow on the peak
won't be nobody's steak
I will teach her to fly
or my tears will run dry

Horses and sheep
you'll all make me weep
if your life is to end
for some ignorant friend

Alley cat sneaking
I look at you peeking
unto evening's litter
a feast all too bitter

Dogs in long leashes
peeing where pleases
dragging 'round 'masters'
out of disasters

Frogs in the night
Town's singing delight
got their own fanzine
for their choral routine

Bat under roof
Mysterious, aloof
Your silent wings flap
when flying your laps

Spider in corner
is not a mourner
when I clean in a gown
and its net gather down

Butterfly fluttering
won't hear me muttering
how its catering nephews
ate all my lettuce

Heartshaped little fly
buzzing near me and by
there's no swatter here
for you, dear, to fear

Silverfish glimmer
in stark lamp light (no dimmer)
you make me gladder
as I empty my bladder

---

bubbling pond hide beneath

Bubbling pond hide beneath
dark waters immense pressure,
the happiest treasure known
You can ignite it
It goes off in a blast
Beautiful, but it does not last
Stay hidden in the glade

---

Chill

Chill, chill, chill,
chill, no ill will.
Speak, squeek, freak
Bleak days, all through the week.
Back, slack, stack,
Hack, my sweater's black
Weep, reap, beep,
Sweep unto the heap

Grab a can of Monster juice
or any drink you wanna choose
Life is wild for any child
or is yours on auto-cruise?

Many rhymes and letters flow
I don't know how else to grow
than letting go and typing on
letter for letter, row for row

---

Double it up to geminus

Double it up to geminus

Stop it in the terminus

Flip around the omnibus

Trouble is not perilous

But larches are coniferous

---

Evening rain

Evening rain
in Northern Spain
A soul in pain
with nothing to gain

Flaming golden hair
Beard like furious fire
Bejeweled blue eyes
Passionate desire

Snivelling snot
Sprouting tears
Throat in a knot
What does it wear?

A beige shirt
Bodhisattva branded
Checkered blue underpants
Sometimes a skirt

---

Feeling more empty

Feeling more empty,
that must be true success
Let me stay like this forever,
bent over a piece of paper

---

frosty morning clouds

Frosty morning clouds like pink baguettes
Windows steamy with one person's breath
The roar of an aluminum albatross
Ocean waves of commuting cars
A bird unheard of, the dog lark
with it first bark, a snark remark
a stark awakening in the park

---

I Am The Earth

I am the Earth
I people myself
I am the most beautiful spaceship you might ever see
I spin and dance around a star
to get evenly shone
I tilt in my spinning dance
to give everyone the chance
to see the colors of seasons
to have plenty of reasons
to count years and to sing
at the arrival of spring
you walk my crust
you are child of my dust
but I say that you must
not stay, nay, I trust
you to set out a course
to explore life in force
the outside of me
stars everywhere you can see
take care of me
like I care for you
and make love be
all you can see
in this galaxy

---

i don't want to give you

I don't want to give you
a purpose on purpose
Why make mere meaning
when you can make miracles
What you think is painful
is not an upcoming event

---

i found it in the park

I found it in the park
this jacket
In a plastic bag
next to a bench
It smells good
I wear it well
It warms me
this wet winter

---

i have no free will

I have no free will, but
I still choose where to go
The trick
Is that I am not going anywhere

---

INFINITE MATRUSHKAS

Having philosophized away the ground beneath
I am lost sliding in and out of these shells
Like infinite matrushkas, the worlds contain themselves,
referring each other in an eternal symbolic dance.

I laugh and do not know who did or why
my trains of thoughts sputter randomly
exhaust themselves like untied balloons

Unpeeling the onion of attachments
Weary of the world I made to suit myself
Thousands of explosions shatter the story of me, a thing apart
All meaning made up, how can making more bring truth?

---

i occasionally collect myself

I occasionally collect myself
like glitter into a trash can
Enter exciting words
like turds
only to blow them all up again

---

It's Time to Ascend

It's time to ascend, transcend and blend
into the sky that never ends
Leave behind the wars and crimes
head into another time
Do the right thing
it's easier than you think
see what you can bring
to prevent us going extinct

---

like flashes of lightning

Like flashes of lightning,
memories flicker
in the thunderstorm of my mind

---

like magnets we attract

Like magnets, we attract
The closer we get, the stronger the bond
We burn away limitations
We soar with new creations
We light up the worlds

We use words but are beyond them
Similar, but not same
Infinite depths within us
Mysterious miracles reflected

Nothing nobody expected
Thus life is perfected

---

rhyme without rhyming

Rhyme without rhyming
Shine without light
Harmonize in discord
Be bluntly sharp

---

standing here

Standing here, wearing the universe as my smile
being all and nothing simultaneously
What to do when illusion is all you know?
Imagine infinite infinities
Eat another pancake?
Go for the ninth dhyana?

---

stirring my cup

Stirring my cup of rooibos tea

the spoon plays

one

two

three
notes from the Imperial March
I haven't paid rent since April
thinking of it my heart springs
enchanted this magical morning

---

The less I know myself

The less I know myself
the more I love myself
Those who say 'know thyself'
really mean the opposite

Walk the path which is not marked
it is infinitely broad
Be the place which is nowhere
and you are everywhere at once

Control a single thing to the utmost degree
divide the moment infinitesimally
By inverting reality
you set yourself free

---

the moon photographed

The moon photographed reappeared
as a frightful vision in a novel
Then it exploded in the future
of a song from years ago

Wading out in cold water

A large lake

Dark green leaves and hanging trees
reflected in the water, four moons.
In this dream, trying to take flight,
I fail and fall back down again

---

The oddest thing

The oddest thing alive

The unsolvable equation

The seamless automation

The inside that is outside

Then only thing that ever was

Did you notice, that it's you?

---

the old is a vice

The old is a vice
an unfree device
Join it, dissolve it
to infinity

To stay out of the clear path,
yet not trip over the vines
Here I am truly speechless

---

water drops in bottle

Water drops in bottle
Left foot in front of right
I start going full throttle
and find my full might

---

we seem to have

We seem to have
lived years together
But where are these now?
